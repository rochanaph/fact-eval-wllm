However , because back pain is more likely to be serious if it occurs in the thoracic area rather than in your neck or lower back , your doctor is likely to suggest tests if the pain persists , is severe , or is accompanied by any of the ' red flag ' features mentioned in the Symptoms section . The tests will depend on the conditions that the doctor wants to rule out . It 's likely to include blood tests such as a full blood count and inflammatory markers , and maybe a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . An ordinary ' plain ' X - ray does n't give much information unless you have an unusual appearance of the spine or a fracture is suspected .,"

Later , they deteriorate and lose consciousness again as the haematoma forms . However , not everyone shows this classic pattern . If you do not lose consciousness after the initial head injury , or if you regain consciousness , you may experience drowsiness or a severe headache . You may also feel sick ( have nausea ) and/or be sick ( have vomiting ) . You may become confused and may develop weakness of an arm and/or a leg on one side of your body and/or speech difficulties . Sometimes a fit ( seizure ) can occur . Some people with an intracranial extradural haematoma can be talking one minute and appear relatively well and can then become very ill and lose consciousness the next . If you have a significant head injury , you should be taken to hospital urgently by ambulance . Anyone who loses consciousness at the time of a head injury should be taken to hospital straightaway .

Even without symptoms , it 's important to diagnose AF because the abnormal rhythm can cause blood clots to form in the heart . Most people with AF need to take a medicine to thin the blood to stop any blood clo t from forming . If a clot does form then it may travel in the blood vessels to your brain and cause a stroke .,"

        "natural": "Aspirin was used in the past for preventing strokes if you have AF but is not as effective as warfarin and is just as likely to cause problems . Aspirin is therefore no longer recommended . The standard anticoagulant has , for many years , been warfarin . There are also new medicines that are as effective as warfarin and may have some advantages . These medicines are dabigatran , apixaban , rivaroxaban and edoxaban . Warfarin can interact with some foods , alcohol and other medicines . Some of the newer anticoagulants ( dabigatran , apixaban , rivaroxaban and edoxaban ) have less interaction with foods , alcohol and other medicines . If you take warfarin you will need regular blood tests ( INR tests ) to check how quickly your blood clots . Blood tests may be needed quite often at first but should become less often quite quickly . The aim is to get the dose of warfarin just right so your blood does not clot as easily as normal but not so much as to cause bleeding problems . Dabigatran , apixaban , edoxaban and rivaroxaban do not need regular blood tests .,"

    {
        "prompt": "What are the benefits and risks of anticoagulant medicines ?",
        "natural": "The benefit of taking warfarin or one of the newer medicines is to reduce your risk of stroke . The main side - effect of these medicines is an increased risk of serious bleeding . Taking warfarin has a risk of bleeding and the dose of warfarin needs to be checked regularly . Therefore you will need to have regular blood tests if you are taking warfarin . If severe bleeding does happen , an injection of vitamin K will help to stop the effect of warfarin and so help to stop the bleeding . The newer medicines ( dabigatran , apixaban , rivaroxaban and edoxaban ) also increase the risk of bleeding . However , they do not increase the risk of bleeding into the brain ( intracranial haemorrhage ) by nearly as much as warfarin . You will not need to have regular blood tests or change the dose of medicine you are taking with the newer medicines . Apixaban , rivaroxaban and edoxaban currently have no treatment to stop the effect of these medicines if you do have severe bleeding . Dabigatran can be reversed quickly with idarucizumab ( Praxbind \u00ae ) . The newer agents do not stay in your body for as long as warfarin does . This means that any problem with bleeding disappears more quickly - usually in 12 - 24 hours .,"

Lymphoma ( Hodgkin 's lymphoma or non - Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) . Myeloma . Your specialist will advise when it may be an appropriate option . As a rule , it is not often a first - line treatment . Conventional chemotherapy or other treatments tend to be used first . However , the treatment of cancer and leukaemia is a changing and developing area of medicine . Techniques such as stem cell transplant continue to be refined and improved and may be considered in various different circumstances . The higher doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that can be used in conjunction with a stem cell transplant can improve the chance of a cure for some conditions in certain circumstances . There is now a great deal of research about using stem cell transplants for many other conditions . For example : For damage to heart tissue ( for example , after a heart attack ) .

The different types of glycogen storage disorder include : Type Ia ( von Gierke 's disease ) , type Ib . Type II ( Pompe 's disease ) . Type III ( Forbes - Cori disease ) . Type IV ( Andersen 's disease ) . Type V ( McArdle 's disease ) . Type VI ( Hers ' disease ) . Type VII ( Tarui 's disease ) . Type IX ( liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency ) . Type XI ( Fanconi - Bickel syndrome ) . Type 0 ( Lewis ' disease ) . Type I glycogen storage disorder is the most common . About one quarter of people who have glycogen storage disorder have type I. It is due to a lack of the enzyme known as glucose-6-phosphatase . Type VIII and type X are now classified with type VI .,"

    {
        "prompt": "What are the treatment options for glycogen storage disorders ?",
        "natural": "The treatment for glycogen storage disorders varies depending on which disorder you have . With most , the treatment aims are to stabilise your blood sugar and energy levels within your body . This is normally achieved by using corn flour ( as used in thickening gravy ) or nutritional supplements such as glucose . A high - protein diet may also be helpful in some glycogen storage disorders . Some people with glycogen storage disorders who do not respond to nutritional supplements may occasionally need a liver transplant . People with glycogen storage disorders affecting their immune system may need to take regular antibiotic medication to protect against infection . In some glycogen storage disorders , clinical trials have successfully used treatment involving replacement of the enzymes that are deficient or not working normally . For example , in glycogen storage disorder type II , this treatment has been shown to help reverse the heart problems and muscle weakness that can occur . Other clinical trials are underway that are looking at gene therapy as a treatment . This is where doctors and scientists aim to cure genetic diseases by introducing normal genes into patients to overcome the effects of faulty genes , using techniques of genetic engineering .,"

        "natural": "When a doctor sees a patient with a sudden facial muscle weakness , he or she will aim to rule out other causes of the problem before diagnosing Bell 's palsy . Most other causes can be ruled out by the absence of other symptoms and by a doctor 's examination . No tests may be needed . However , some tests are done in some situations . For example , in areas where Lyme disease is common ( due to tick bites ) then tests to rule out Lyme disease may be done .

Your vision becomes affected . Your newborn or very young baby develops conjunctivitis . Most conjunctival infections are not serious , do not harm the eye , and clear in a few days . However , some infections such as herpes or chlamydia persist for longer than usual , are more serious and need special treatment . Most serious eye infections feel different to simple conjunctivitis because they cause significant pain . Many also affect vision . Some other conditions , including allergic conjunctivitis , can appear similar to infective conjunctivitis initially .

Your health visitor or doctor may then ask you a few questions and watch your child . They may want your child to have a hearing test . Sometimes hearing problems can make it difficult for a child to be sociable . If they are concerned about an ASD they may ask a special team to observe your child . This team will normally be made up of several different types of health professional . They will observe your child over a period of time before making a decision about the diagnosis . Their observations decide whether your child has an ASD . Blood tests may be taken . These do not test for an ASD but help to look for and rule out other conditions that may seem similar .,"

        "natural": "Dystonia is very rarely a cause of death . If dystonia develops in childhood and starts in the legs , it may spread to other parts of the body , and can become generalised . This can be severely disabling . Dystonia in adults is usually limited to one part of the body ( focal dystonia ) . Spreading is unlikely but usually affects only one other area , which is commonly the nearest muscle group . Dystonia is unpredictable and the severity of symptoms can vary from day to day . There may be worsening over a period of time but it can be difficult to say how long this will last . A focal dystonia tends to worsen very gradually over a five - year period but then often stays the same . Sometimes a dystonia may improve or disappear altogether for no apparent reason . The chances of this happening have been estimated as somewhere between 1 in 10 and 1 in 20 . Sometimes the dystonia comes back , but at other times it will disappear completely .

Damage already done to your airways can not be reversed . However , stopping smoking prevents the disease from worsening . It is never too late to stop smoking , at any stage of the disease . Even if you have fairly advanced COPD , you are likely to benefit and prevent further progression of the disease . Your cough may get worse for a while when you give up smoking . This often happens as the lining of the airways ' comes back to life ' . Resist the temptation to start smoking again to ease the cough . An increase in cough after you stop smoking usually settles in a few weeks . The National Health Service ( NHS ) provides free help and advice for people having difficulty in stopping smoking . Medication , such as varenicline and bupropion , and nicotine replacement therapy ( such as patches and chewing gum ) can be prescribed , and counselling offered .

Mild reactions such as a slight fever , a mild sore throat and joint pains sometimes occur about 1 - 3 weeks after the injection . These soon subside and are of no consequence . A few children develop a mild swollen face ( like a mild form of mumps ) about three weeks later . Any swelling will gradually go down . None of these reactions is infectious or serious .

To overcome this tolerance the dose schedule aims to leave your blood free of nitrate , or with very low levels of it , for a few hours each day .

The amount of blistering can vary : sometimes it is just one area , such as the lower leg . In severe cases , the whole body may be affected . The skin over the blisters is quite strong . It may be several days before the blister bursts . A raw patch of skin is left when a blister bursts , which then heals . Some blisters do not burst ; instead the fluid is absorbed into the body and the roof of the blister settles back down on the skin . The blisters usually heal without forming scars . Some people with bullous pemphigoid get small blisters inside the mouth . The blisters can break to form erosions which look like mouth ulcers . Bullous pemphigoid is usually itchy .

The possible complications , which are more likely to happen after severe breaks , include : Failed healing of the bones : this can either mean the bones heal in a crooked state or that they do n't heal together at all . In either case further surgery may be needed . Bone infection : this is called osteomyelitis and can be very persistent . There is a risk of this if the skin over the fractured toe is damaged . A long course of antibiotics or further surgery may be needed . Toe stiffness is a common consequence of a broken toe , particularly if the joint was involved . Joints anywhere in the body which have had blood in them have a tendency to become stiffer . Physiotherapy exercises may help . Pain : it is quite common to have occasional aches and pains in a bone that has been broken , particularly after heavy use . More severe pain suggests further treatment is needed .

In most cases , a TIA is caused by a tiny blood clot that becomes stuck in a small blood vessel ( artery ) in the brain . This blocks the blood flow and a part of the brain is starved of oxygen . The affected part of the brain is without oxygen for just a few minutes and soon recovers . This is because the blood clot either breaks up quickly or nearby blood vessels are able to compensate .

Or because you are not currently in a position to have children , because of your job , relationship or finances . The great thing about LARCs is the word \" reversible \" - so if your situation changes , you can stop using them and become fertile again . You do n't need to take a tablet every day , so for most LARCs , you can forget about contraception for years at a time . This makes them more reliable ( as they do n't need you to remember , other than when they are due to be replaced ) . The main downside is that they all require a small procedure of some sort .

Pain when you pass urine ( although the common reason for this is a urine infection and not an STI ) . Swelling of the glands in your groin . But remember , in many cases of STI , no symptoms may develop . However , you can still pass on the infection to others even if you have no symptoms . Therefore , if you think that you may have an STI , it is best to get it checked out .,"

        "natural": "Yes . Also , any other sexual partners within the previous six months should also be tested for infection . If your sexual partner is infected and not treated then chlamydia can be passed back to you again after you are treated . There may be certain occasions when you may not want to contact partners from previous relationships . In these cases staff at the clinic can contact previous partners for you without disclosing your details . This is because it is important that anyone who is at risk of infection with chlamydia be both identified and treated .,"

When you get to the end of week 3 , simply put on another patch and start the cycle as if it is week 1 . This will not always work , and you may have some breakthrough bleeding . If you have used the patch correctly every seven days , you are unlikely to be pregnant . If you prefer not to have a period or withdrawal bleed at all , you could consider other methods of contraception instead of the contraceptive patch . There are some contraceptive options where periods are extremely light or do not occur at all . These include the contraceptive implant , the intrauterine system , and contraceptive injections .

        "prompt": "What are the causes of lower urinary tract symptoms ?",
        "natural": "There are various causes of LUTS . The more common causes include : An enlarged prostate gland . The prostate gland ( referred to from now on here as the prostate ) is situated around the neck of your bladder . When this gets bigger it can cause voiding symptoms . See the separate leaflet called Prostate Gland Enlargement for more details . Overactive bladder . As men ( and women ) get older , it is more common to develop bladder control problems . Your bladder may also be less able to store urine . This leads to you needing to pass urine more frequently and can even lead to leakage of urine at times ( incontinence ) . See the separate leaflet called Overactive Bladder Syndrome for more details . Water balance problems . As people get older , it becomes harder for the body to reduce the amount of urine that they pass at night . This leads to the need to pass urine more often at night . Therefore , at the age of 65 and over it can be normal to pass urine at least once a night . Other causes of LUTS include diabetes mellitus , urinary infections , bladder stones , prostate cancer , bladder cancer and neurological conditions ( eg , multiple sclerosis ) .,"

        "natural": "Many people with globus sensation are worried that it could be a sign of another problem , particularly a cancer . Globus sensation needs to be distinguished from a difficulty with swallowing ( dysphagia ) . When we eat , food passes from our mouth , down the gullet ( oesophagus ) , into the stomach and then into the small and then large intestine . For people with dysphagia , there is a delay in the passage of fluids or solids from the mouth , down the gullet and to the stomach . Someone with dysphagia will notice that their foods , particularly solid foods , feel like they are getting stuck as they swallow . There are a number of problems that can lead to the symptom of dysphagia . The problem can stem from something going wrong at any point in the swallowing process , from the mouth to lower down in the gullet . See the separate leaflet called Difficulty Swallowing ( Dysphagia ) for the many conditions which can be possible causes . Sometimes it can be very difficult to tell the difference between globus sensation and dysphagia . As mentioned above , one clue could be that unlike someone with dysphagia , someone with globus sensation does not usually have any problems eating or drinking . Also , dysphagia can be constant and may become gradually worse over time , whereas globus sensation symptoms tend to come and go .,"

        "natural": "The symptoms often indicate the diagnosis of PoTS . Your doctor will arrange blood tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms . You will need to be referred to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis . The investigations used to confirm the diagnosis of PoTS or to exclude other conditions may include : Active stand test . You lie flat for a few minutes and your heart rate and blood pressure are recorded . After standing up , further recordings of your heart rate and blood pressure are taken over the following 10 minutes . Tilt table test . You lie flat on a special bed and your heart rate and blood pressure are recorded . The bed is then tilted ( head end up ) for up to 45 minutes while further recordings of your heart rate and blood pressure are taken . Diagram reproduced from PoTS UK Both the active stand test and the tilt table test are stopped if you faint or if enough recordings have been made either to confirm or to exclude the diagnosis . Other tests may include a 12-lead heart tracing ( electrocardiogram , or ECG ) , 24-hour ECG , 24-hour blood pressure monitoring and a heart ultrasound scan ( echocardiogram ) .

Sometimes the fungal infection beds down deeply into the scalp , which responds by creating a very sore , thick bumpy mass of fungal infection called a kerion . This can look like a cluster of boils and be mistaken for a bacterial infection , when the actual infection is caused by a fungus . Antibiotics will not help for a kerion : you need antifungal tablets like terbinafine or griseofulvin . This image shows a kerion in a young boy in Iran : Image source : Open - i ( Babamahmoodi F et al ) - see Further reading below Very occasionally the inflammation caused by a fungal infection can lead on to a ' secondary ' bacterial skin infection .

That is , when your palm is flat and stretched out and your wrist is bent backwards as you fall to the ground . Instinctively , you will usually put your hands out in this position for protection if you fall forwards . Sometimes a direct blow to the palm of your hand can cause a scaphoid fracture . Rarely , repeated ' stress ' on the scaphoid bone can lead to a fracture . This can occur , for example , in gymnasts and shot putters . Commonly you will fracture only your scaphoid bone but sometimes other bones around the wrist area may be broken at the same time . Scaphoid fractures may be non - displaced ( the fragments of the broken bone have n't moved out of position ) or displaced ( there is some movement of the bone fragments ) .,"

This is a sensitivity to any of the creams , ointments or dressings you have applied to the skin . Patch testing involves putting various chemicals in patches on to the skin to see whether a reaction develops . This is usually done by a skin specialist ( dermatologist ) . You may also be referred to a dermatologist for more specialised advice about your skin problem . Lack of progress sometimes means that infection has set in . Antibiotic tablets , such as flucloxacillin , may be needed if this is the case . You may need to be referred to a surgeon who specialises in arteries and veins ( a vascular surgeon ) .

Children are more likely to be bitten on the head or neck and are therefore more likely to have the more serious bites . Severe dog bites occur most often in children under the age of 5 years . Some dogs are more dangerous than others . Those thought to be most dangerous include rottweilers , pit bull terriers , and German shepherd dogs , but even small dogs can inflict serious bites .

        "prompt": "How is Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) diagnosed ?",
        "natural": "The diagnosis may be suspected because of the child 's symptoms ( above ) . When looking for signs of DMD , it is important to watch the child running and getting up from the floor - the muscle weakness is more noticeable during these activities . Tests are needed before DMD can be diagnosed . The first step in making the diagnosis is a blood test . This tests for creatine kinase . Children with DMD always have a very high level of creatine kinase ( about 10 - 100 times normal ) . Therefore , if a child 's creatine kinase level is normal then DMD is ruled out . If the creatine kinase level is high , further tests are needed to see whether this is due to DMD or to some other condition . The next step in diagnosing DMD involves either a muscle biopsy and/or genetic tests : A muscle biopsy involves taking a small sample of a muscle , under local anaesthetic . The sample is examined under a microscope using special techniques to look at the muscle fibres and the dystrophin protein . Genetic tests are done using a blood sample . The DNA in the blood is tested to look at the dystrophin gene . This test can diagnose most cases of DMD .,"

        "natural": "If possible , rest your voice when you have laryngitis . If you overuse your voice when the vocal cords are inflamed , it may make the inflammation worse . It is unlikely to do any permanent damage but it may take longer for your normal voice to return . Resting the voice means not shouting , singing or talking for long periods . Quiet conversation is usually fine . A sighing soft speech is best rather than whispering until the laryngitis has gone . This is because whispering makes your voice box ( larynx ) work harder than soft sighing speech . Once you can hum comfortably , you can probably start talking normally again . If you are a performer such as a singer , it can be a difficult decision as to when to start singing again . Singing too early , when symptoms are easing , may prolong the hoarse voice longer than if you rest it fully until symptoms have completely gone . There is no easy answer as to the earliest it is safe to sing without doing any more harm . A professional singer may wish to consult a speech therapist if a crucial decision is to be made about an important singing engagement .,"

HPV types 6 and 11 cause over 9 in 10 cases of anogenital warts . However , some other types of HPV do increase your risk of developing cancer . You may have more than one type of HPV infection at the same time ( one type that causes anogenital warts and one type that may increase your risk of cancer ) . It is known that most cases of cancer of the neck of the womb ( cervix ) are caused by HPV infection . So , it is particularly important that women with anogenital warts have cervical screening tests at the usual recommended times and do not put it off . You do not need to have cervical screening tests more regularly if you have anogenital warts . See the separate leaflet called Cervical Screening ( Cervical Smear Test ) for further details .

Many cases develop soon after using a topical steroid on the face for another condition , such as mild eczema . Without realising you are doing so , you may even rub some steroid on your face if you are treating another part of your body with a topical steroid . For example , you may scratch the treated area of your skin ( say , your elbow ) and then , without realising you are doing so , rub the finger used for scratching on to your face . Topical steroids can also clear a mild patch of perioral dermatitis temporarily . Some people will have tried a steroid cream , which can be bought at pharmacies , to treat what they think is mild eczema . However , as soon as the rash clears and the steroid is stopped , the rash reappears , only even worse . This can become a vicious circle as they may then put more steroid cream on to clear the new rash , which may clear again . They may stop the steroid again , only for the rash to come back yet again and even worse , etc .,"

        "prompt": "What can be done for Setting Back Prominent Ears ?",
        "natural": "When an ear is noted to be prominent within the first few weeks of life , it is possible to reshape it by applying a small splint to the rim . The cartilage or gristle of a new - born 's ear is very floppy and easily remoulded and after several weeks of splintage a permanent correction can be achieved . The older the child , the more stiff the cartilage and the longer the period of splintage must be . By the age of six months the cartilage is too hard to be remoulded and a surgical solution is required . Pinnaplasty or otoplasty is an operation which adjusts the shape of the cartilage within the ear to create the missing folds and to allow the ear to lie closer to the side of the head . Because the operation is carried out from behind the ears , a small scar is left close to the groove between the ear and the side of the head . The procedure can be carried out under local anaesthetic , but in young children a general anaesthetic is usually required . Where the lobe of the ear is especially large , a small procedure to reduce its size may also be required .,"

        "prompt": "What are the consequences for Setting Back Prominent Ears ?",
        "natural": "A small protective dressing is usually worn after the surgery until the stitches are removed at between 5 - 10 days after surgery . Once the dressing has been discarded , it is wise to wear a protective head - band or bandage when sleeping to avoid the ears being bent forward against the pillow . The ears are often sore and tender for several weeks and painkilling medication such as paracetamol or codeine may be required . Other drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen can occasionally cause unwanted bleeding following the surgery and should be avoided . The scar behind the ear usually settles well , but on rare occasions it can become red and lumpy . A small number of patients , particularly those who are very sensitive about the precise shape of their ears , may require a minor adjustment procedure . The vast majority of patients , however , are well pleased by the result , and the procedure has a high satisfaction rate .,"
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the limitations for Setting Back Prominent Ears ?",
        "natural": "The operation is most often done during childhood , but it is best to operate when the patient is 5 years old or more , as until then the cartilage is very floppy and does not hold the stitches well . It is recommended that although parents may feel that their child 's ears should be corrected to avoid teasing and stigmatisation it is best to wait until the child recognises the problem and wants the ears corrected . Children are generally more co - operative and happy with the outcome when they fully understand why the surgery is taking place . Pinnaplasty is also performed during the teenage years and in adult life , when either a local or general anaesthetic can be used .,"

Camels in the Middle East are thought to be the cause of spread to humans . The virus was first recognised in a patient who died from a severe lung illness ( respiratory illness ) in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 . Most initial cases of MERS occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . People infected with MERS have now been reported in Europe , the USA and Asia . Since May 2015 , South Korea has been investigating an outbreak of MERS . So far MERS has only affected people in a few places . However , it is possible that the virus could alter so that it spreads more easily . MERS could then cause infections throughout the world . MERS can vary from not causing any symptoms , to a mild disease , or to a severe illness causing death .

Occasionally , coarctation of the aorta does not cause any symptoms or is not detected until adult life . Symptoms result from heart failure because the heart is not able to push blood through the narrowed part of the aorta . This causes a back - pressure of blood and congestion of the lungs , leading to symptoms including shortness of breath . Patients with less severe narrowing will present later as they develop extra blood vessels , called collateral blood vessels , so that some blood is able to bypass the narrowed part of the aorta .

Some authorities , such as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) in the UK , or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in the USA , advise against the use of e - cigarettes in pregnancy . This is because there is not currently enough evidence to be sure they are safe when you are pregnant . Other authorities , however , such as the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group , feel the risk of e - cigarettes is lower than the risk of continuing smoking . This group advises that although nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) is the preferred method of quitting , if a medicinal product is needed , e - cigarettes are safer than continuing to smoke . It is likely that more information will become available in the next few years about safety in pregnancy . Meanwhile the safest approach is probably to see it as a last resort if you are unable to stop smoking any other way in pregnancy .

Sprains do not need X - ray , and doctors prefer to avoid unnecessary X - rays in order to keep your lifetime exposure to radiation as low as possible . Ottawa Rules These are a set of rules devised by doctors to determine which ankle injuries should be X - rayed to look for fracture . They centre on whether there is bony tenderness at certain points around the ankle . If there is no bony tenderness in any of these points AND you are able to weight bear ( both in casualty when seen and immediately after the injury ) then fracture is unlikely and you will not need to be X - rayed . If , however , any of those features ARE present then an X - ray will be offered in order to detect or rule out fracture .,"

It is also known as EBUS TBNA for short . The procedure is carried out using a special kind of bronchoscope . This is a thin flexible kind of ' telescope ' which passes through the mouth and into the airways . The bronchoscope ( often shortened to ' scope ' ) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and carry out the procedure . Endobronchial means from inside or within the bronchus . The bronchi ( the plural of bronchus ) are large tube - like airways . They take air from the windpipe ( trachea ) to the smaller airways , called the bronchioles . During the procedure ultrasound is used to help the doctor doing the test see the structures just outside the airways . This gives the test the first part of its name . The scope also contains a very fine needle . This needle is used to take samples of body tissue by pushing through the bronchus to the tissue on the other side . The needle holds the sample of tissue ; this is called aspiration . Transbronchial means across the bronchus , giving the name transbronchial needle aspiration .,"

This blocks the blood flow , and a part of the brain is starved of oxygen . The affected part of the brain is without oxygen for just a few minutes , and soon recovers . This is because the blood clot either breaks up quickly , or nearby blood vessels are able to compensate . There are other uncommon causes of a TIA . These include : Blood clotting problems .

For example , some medicines used to treat other conditions can cause side - effects which resemble symptoms of PD . Some rare brain disorders can also cause similar symptoms . Therefore , it is normal practice in the UK to be referred to a specialist if PD is suspected . The specialist will be used to diagnosing PD and ruling out other causes of the symptoms .
