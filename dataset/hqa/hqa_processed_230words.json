        "natural": "generated by the TENS machine interfere with and block pain messages sent to the brain . This is due to the gate control theory of pain . This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain . When the machine is set on a low pulse rate ( 2 - 5 Hz ) it stimulates the body to make its own pain - easing chemicals called endorphins . These act a bit like morphine to block pain signals .,"

Dyspraxia does not affect intelligence . It does , however , place extra hurdles in the way of children during their educational years . In any group of children there is a broad range of abilities , and children develop at different rates . Children with dyspraxia are not abnormal children ; they are the group of children whose motor co - ordination is developing most slowly , so that some things are harder for them to learn . This does n't mean the skills which they find difficult can not be learned , just that children with dyspraxia will find them harder to learn than other children do .

If dyspraxia is recognised at this stage , children can be given extra help in developing their skills , rather than being told off or made to feel they are not trying hard enough . Dyspraxia may affect everyday life skills in many ways , both because of the motor difficulties and because of difficulties with organisation . Children may have problems with self - care , organising themselves and their belongings , and in engaging with groups of other children . They may also have problems with organising their thoughts , which can affect organised mental tasks like mental maths , learning material for examinations , and planning timetables .

When this development is markedly impaired , we term it dyspraxia , as we realise it represents a real challenge to your child . A number of things have been suggested that may increase the risk of dyspraxia : Dyspraxia seems to run in families , so it seems to have a genetic component - the way your child is ' made ' . This suggests that , in some children , a less effective development of the motor nerves may be something that is pre - programmed into their genes . Premature babies , particularly those of very low birth weight , seem to be at greater risk of dyspraxia .

For example , the space between the long bones ( metatarsals ) in the foot is narrower between the second and third and between the third and fourth metatarsals . This means that the nerves that run between these metatarsals are more likely to be compressed and irritated . Wearing narrow shoes can make this compression worse .

Along with the hearing test , you will often have tympanometry , which is a test of the eardrum and the bones of the middle of your ear . A probe is placed in your ear ( which feels much like when the doctor looks inside your ear ) , a tone is produced and the pressures changed in your ear . The response is then measured . An underlying ear problem can usually be ruled out by this examination and hearing test . Further tests such as a brain scan are done in a few cases , although this is not necessary for most people with tinnitus . For example , a brain scan may be advised if you have one - sided tinnitus and an underlying brain disorder is suspected . In some cases , a blood test may be done .

The 2014 - 2016 outbreak infected over 26,000 people , of whom around about 4 out of every 10 died . It was eventually contained , through improved public health and hospital care and with the involvement of the population in preventing spread .

The risk appears to have gone down in recent years but it is n't known if this is because of better pregnancy care or as a result of obstetricians advising women to have their labour induced at around 37 - 38 weeks . There is also an increased risk of your baby passing poo ( called meconium ) whilst they are in the womb . This can irritate the baby 's lungs if breathed in when they are being born . There is possibly a slightly increased risk of more bleeding from the womb than is normal just after giving birth . However , again the research is not definite and there may not be any increased risk of this .,"

Both the itch and the high levels of liver enzymes and bile salts will go away soon after your baby is born . A blood test is usually done at least 10 days after your baby is born to confirm that everything is back to normal . This sometimes helps to confirm that the diagnosis was obstetric cholestasis , if there had been any doubt .

Therefore , a raised level of TSH means the thyroid gland is underactive and is not making enough thyroxine . Thyroxine . A low level of thyroxine confirms hypothyroidism . Other tests are not usually necessary unless a rare cause of hypothyroidism is suspected . For example , tests of the pituitary gland may be done if both the TSH and thyroxine levels are low . Some people have a raised TSH level but have a normal thyroxine level . This means that you are making enough thyroxine but the thyroid gland is needing extra stimulation from TSH to make the required amount of thyroxine .

Phentolamine does seem to improve arousal , but there is no good evidence for yohimbine in improving FSD . Despite this , yohimbine ( available as a food supplement ) is widely marketed as a sexual performance enhancer . A few other medicines may have a role in treating FSD . Promising substances include : Alprostadil ( a cream applied to the genital area which seems to increase blood flow and , therefore , arousal ) .

When producing mature milk , each breast will produce ' richer ' milk with a higher fat content towards the end of a feed when it is nearly empty , so it is important that breast - feeding babies get the opportunity to empty one breast before feeding from the other , so that they can access this richer milk .,"

Also research has shown that a number of medicines can be used to prevent illness . Increasing numbers of guidelines recommend treating people at risk of certain medical conditions . Guidelines in the UK for the use of the cholesterol - reducing medicines called statins , for example , recommend their use in pretty much everybody over the age of 70 as well as many under the age of 70 , even if their cholesterol levels are normal .

For example , it may be used if symptoms are bad enough for surgery . In this case , it might save you having to have an operation . If your tennis elbow symptoms persist for some time and are really troublesome then a specialist may advise an operation . The common operation to ease symptoms is to remove the damaged part of the tendon . Only a small number of people require surgery to relieve symptoms . Each treatment option for Tennis Elbow has various benefits , risks and consequences . In collaboration with health.org.uk , we 've put together a summary decision aid that encourages patients and doctors to discuss and assess what 's available .,"

Unfortunately , someone did this when he was unprepared . Even more unhappily , he had appendicitis at the time . His appendix burst and this resulted in his death some hours later . If an appendix mass has formed then surgeons sometimes suggest postponing surgery whilst they drain the mass and treat with antibiotics , before doing a full appendicectomy a few weeks later .

Taking a statin was associated with a 36 % increased risk of subsequently being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , compared to those who had not been prescribed these medicines . The risk fell to 30 % after taking other factors into account . Although those who were prescribed statins had slightly higher levels of blood glucose to start with , this still did n't explain their higher rates of diabetes .

When the person has been unwell for around 10 days or more , with no improvement , the clinician can consider prescribing a high - dose nasal steroid for 14 days for adults and children aged 12 years and over . Alternatively they may provide a back - up antibiotic prescription , taking account of evidence that antibiotics make little difference to how long symptoms last , or the proportion of people with improved symptoms ; withholding antibiotics is unlikely to lead to complications ; antibiotics may cause possible adverse effects , particularly diarrhoea and nausea .

This involves a surgeon pushing a small balloon through a flexible tube in the nostril , into the blocked sinus . The balloon is inflated which pushes wide the blocked area . The balloon is then deflated and removed . Following this procedure there is a good chance that the sinus drainage channel is widened and the sinus can drain properly .

You may notice soreness of the eyes , the inside of the mouth , the throat , the nostrils and the genitals . You may have difficulty eating and drinking . You may notice burning when you pass urine . A rash develops , usually on the face or trunk , which spreads to large areas of the body . It starts with flat red spots , which turn into raised bumps . If you have Stevens - Johnson syndrome you might notice some spots develop small blisters in the centre to give the typical appearance of ' target lesions ' . Blisters can run together to form large fluid - filled areas known as bullae . In toxic dermatolysis , blistering can become very severe and lead to large areas of skin peeling off .,"

The appearance of the tumour under the microscope ( histology ) . Tumours with more normal - looking cells are lower - risk . Genetic changes . Some neuroblastoma tumours have too many of a gene called MYCN , which controls the growth of the cell . These cells grow quickly and are less likely to develop properly .

These structures are easily damaged if enough force is applied . The muscles and ligaments around the shoulder tend to be stretchy and relatively vulnerable ( compared to those around the hip ) . Thus the shoulder is relatively easy to dislocate . The hip is much harder to dislocate even though it is also a ball and socket joint . This is because the socket is deeper and the ligaments and muscles much bigger and stronger .

Very few women are able to breast feed following breast reduction surgery as the nipples are separated from the underlying milk ducts and at the time of pregnancy the milk supply will gradually dry up , sometimes with the assistance of hormone treatment . Breast reduction is no contra - indication to pregnancy but young women may well wish to take the fact that they are unable to breast feed into account before embarking on this procedure .

It may start off as a small red lump but , as it develops into a collection of pus ( a little abscess ) , it looks like a yellow pus - filled spot . The edge of the eyelid around it becomes reddened and swollen , and the lid is painful . An internal stye arises when a type of gland in the main part of the eyelid ( meibomian gland ) becomes infected . The infection comes to a head on the inner surface of the eyelid , against the eyeball , so that from the outside it is visible only as a swelling . Internal styes may be painful , although often they cause a dull aching in the eyelid , sometimes with the sensation of a lump .,"

After a few days , your body starts to adjust ( acclimatise ) to the higher level of altitude that you are at . You will notice that your breathing rate will start to slow down . Your body also makes more red blood cells to help with oxygen transport around your body . Because of these changes in your body , there are some ' normal ' symptoms that you will notice at higher altitudes while your body is acclimatising and adjusting to the reduced availability of oxygen .

A common side - effect with acetazolamide is pins and needles . A steroid medication called dexamethasone may be an alternative . Sometimes oxygen treatment may be used .

A further two studies did not show any benefit with folic acid in reducing major congenital malformation . This could be due to different mechanisms causing FACS .

Being overweight or obese is not the underlying cause of PCOS . However , if you are overweight or obese , excess fat can make insulin resistance worse . This may then cause the level of insulin to rise even further . High levels of insulin can contribute to further weight gain producing a ' vicious cycle ' . Losing weight , although difficult , can help break this cycle .,"

Depression or poor self - esteem may develop as a result of the other symptoms . Symptoms typically begin in the late teens or early 20s . Not all symptoms occur in all women with PCOS . For example , some women with PCOS have some excess hair growth but have normal periods and fertility . Symptoms can vary from mild to severe . For example , mild unwanted hair is normal , and it can be difficult to say when it becomes abnormal in women with mild PCOS . At the other extreme , women with severe PCOS can have marked hair growth , infertility and obesity . Symptoms may also change over the years .

In elderly people their tear ducts often get narrower with age . So the tears ca n't drain away properly , making their eyes very watery . Occasionally the blocked tear duct gets a mild infection and makes the skin just between the nose and eye red and sore . In the elderly the eyelashes can turn inwards , scratching the eyeball and making it sore and watery . This is called entropion and can be corrected with surgery . Because the eyelids can become a bit lax and relaxed with age , the lower eyelids can droop outwards . Then tears just drop out of the eye instead of draining away down the tear ducts .

If the probe goes as far as the tear sac then fluid can be syringed into the tear duct to see if it comes out in the nose . Syringing may sometimes clear a blockage , but it may only give temporary relief . If there seems to be a blockage then a dye may be injected into the tear duct . An X - ray picture is then taken . You can see the dye in the duct on the X - ray film . It will show exactly where there is any obstruction or narrowing of the tear duct .

If one side of the quadriceps muscles pulls harder than the other side , the patella may not glide smoothly and may rub on one side . A combination of an alignment problem ( as above ) and overuse with sports , may be the most common reason for developing chondromalacia patellae .

If you have one of these genes plus a sickle gene , you also get SCD ( the combination behaves like two sickle cell genes ) . Examples of these interacting genes are HbC , beta thalassaemia , Hb Lepore and HbO Arab . The result of these genes is that an important body chemical called haemoglobin is altered . This is what affects the red blood cells and makes them change into a sickle shape . With sickle cell trait , you have only small amounts of altered haemoglobin , so the blood cells are not much affected ( unless conditions are very extreme ) .

These are medicines such as omeprazole and lansoprazole that are taken to suppress acid production in the stomach as a treatment for acid reflux and indigestion . Note : if you have had C. difficile infection once , you have about a 1 in 4 - 5 chance that you will have infection again in the future .

Also , diarrhoea after a course of antibiotics may not necessarily be due to C. difficile infection . For example , some antibiotics such as erythromycin can cause diarrhoea as a side - effect because the antibiotic medicine speeds up stomach emptying . Also , because antibiotics can upset the balance of the harmless germs ( bacteria ) in the gut that normally help to control our bowel movements , diarrhoea after a course of antibiotics can also occur for this reason . Only around 1 in 5 people who develop diarrhoea after a course of antibiotics actually have C. difficile infection . But C. difficile should be considered as a possibility in the situations described above . A stool ( faeces ) sample can be tested in the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis . The test looks for the poison ( toxin ) that is produced by C. difficile in the stool sample . Blood tests , an X - ray of your tummy ( abdomen ) or a CT scan may be suggested if you have more severe infection .,"

See the separate leaflet called Gastroenteritis for more details . In the small number of cases that progress into fulminant colitis , surgery may be needed , especially if the colon perforates . Antidiarrhoeal medicines such as loperamide should not be used if C. difficile infection is suspected . This is because it is thought that they may slow down the rate at which the poisons ( toxins ) produced by the bacteria are cleared from your gut .

This is because the thickness of your cornea can affect your intraocular pressure reading . A special lens may also be used to examine the drainage area ( or trabecular meshwork area ) of your eye .

As with all operations , there is a small risk of complications . Also , the operation may have to be repeated in some cases .

Rheumatoid arthritis is a form of arthritis that causes inflammation , pain and swelling of joints . If you have gout or pseudogout you have an increased risk of developing a bursitis . Gout is caused by a build - up of uric acid crystals . Uric acid is a chemical in the blood that is usually harmless and passed out with the urine .

Sometimes it gets stuck along the way , and sometimes can be felt as a small lump in the groin . Baby boys are checked at birth and at six weeks to be sure their testicles are in the scrotum . If the testicles have not moved down to the scrotum by the age of 6 months they may need an operation to move the testicles to where they should be .

Blood tests may also be helpful . These can help determine if swollen lymph glands are due to infection , and in some cases blood tests can help find the cause of the infection . In people who get repeated boils or abscesses a blood test to check for an underlying reason such as diabetes may be useful . Occasionally it may be necessary to take a sample of the lump for further analysis . This is called a biopsy . A sample of the tissue inside the lump can be taken with a thin needle , or the whole lump removed . The sample is then examined under the microscope to find out the cause . This is helpful if some kind of cancerous lump or lymph gland is suspected .,"

A small number of people have complications following banding , such as bleeding , infection or ulcers forming at the site of a treated haemorrhoid , or urinary problems . Injection sclerotherapy Phenol in oil is injected into the tissues at the base of the piles . This causes a scarring ( fibrotic ) reaction which obliterates the blood vessels going to the piles . The piles then die and drop off , similar to after banding . Infrared coagulation / photocoagulation This method uses infrared energy to burn and cut off the circulation to the haemorrhoid , which causes it to shrink in size . It seems to be as effective as banding treatment and injection sclerotherapy for first- and second - degree piles . Diathermy and electrotherapy This uses heat energy to destroy the piles . They appear to have similar success rates as infrared coagulation and the risk of any complications is low .,"

A blood test for a chemical marker of certain diseases - called HLA B27 - is positive in 90 % of people who have enthesitis - related JIA . A family history of illnesses associated with being HLA B27-positive , including ankylosing spondylitis , inflammation affecting the eye ( uveitis ) , psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis . The child affected with enthesitis - related arthritis also has other illnesses associated with being positive for HLA B27 . The arthritis affects a boy and starts when the boy is over the age of 6 . Undifferentiated JIA is used to describe arthritis that does n't fit into any of the other different groups of JIA .,"

A high fever often occurs , most often in the afternoon or evening , with a rapid return of the temperature to normal . A rash often appears with the fever . The rash is usually a light pink colour and quickly disappears . Arthritis only occurs at the start of the disease in about one third of children but usually develops within a few months . The arthritis usually affects several joints . This affects girls twice as often as boys and tends to start at about 6 years of age . The arthritis affects both small and large joints . In over half of affected children , the arthritis starts before the psoriasis . This affects boys much more often than girls and usually starts after 10 years of age . It often affects the legs and may cause pain in the heel . There is often swelling of a knee or foot .

Blood tests may also be useful to see whether any infection ( virus or bacteria ) has caused the arthritis and not JIA . Other blood tests are used to see if there is a positive test for chemicals which are markers for different types of inflammation . Examples of these markers are called antinuclear antibodies , RF and HLA B27 . Other tests include the following : X - rays , which are normal in the early stages of JIA but help to check for any other bone or joint problems such as infection or injury . Ultrasound scans to see if there is any fluid in the joint and the extent of arthritis of the joint . MRI scans to show details of the damage to the joint and any changes of the bones surrounding the joints .

One of the ways doctors assess the stage of a cancer is to see if it has spread to structures called lymph nodes . Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system . This is a network of channels and vessels that carry a fluid called lymph . Lymph nodes act like a filter for lymph . They contain white blood cells which can recognise germs ( bacteria and pathogens ) which have entered the lymph via the bloodstream . When foreign material is detected , other dedicated immune cells are recruited to the node to deal with the infection . This is why lymph nodes may become swollen when you have an infection . Lymph nodes can also become swollen in some forms of cancer . Cancer cells can break off from the main tumour and enter the lymph . These cells may then collect in the lymph nodes . By checking the lymph nodes for signs of cancerous cells , doctors can see if cancer has spread within the body . See separate leaflet called Staging and Grading Cancer for more details .,"

The echoes are detected by the probe and are sent to the ultrasound machine . They are displayed as a picture on the monitor . The picture is constantly updated so the scan can show movement as well as structure . In effect , the ultrasound allows the doctor to see through the airways by showing what is on the other side . This allows the doctor to find the lymph node or tissue they want to sample . Then they can use the needle to take a sample of that tissue , while avoiding other structures such as blood vessels .

However , in practice , many people will not fall neatly into any one category , and considerable overlap occurs . Note : remember that passing blood is not a symptom of IBS .

Intolerance to certain foods may play a part in some cases . However , this is thought to be only in a small number of cases . Infection and germs ( bacteria ) in the gut . IBS is not caused by an ongoing gut infection . However , in some cases , the onset of symptoms seems to follow a bout of a gut infection with diarrhoea and being sick ( vomiting ) , called gastroenteritis . So , perhaps a virus or other germ may sensitise or trigger the gut in some way to cause persisting symptoms of IBS . Oversensitivity to pain .

Because the fatty , protective layer within the skin is lost , it is thought that some people with discoid eczema may also have an increased risk of developing contact dermatitis .

This is called acid reflux , which can cause heartburn and/or inflammation of the gullet ( oesophagitis ) . Antacids work by counteracting ( neutralising ) the acid in your stomach . They do this because the chemicals in antacids are bases ( alkalis ) which are the opposite of acids . A reaction between an acid and base is called neutralisation . This neutralisation makes the stomach contents less corrosive . This can help to relieve the pain associated with ulcers and the burning sensation in acid reflux . When antacids work on stomach acid , they can produce gas which may cause wind ( flatulence ) . Simeticone helps to stop this foaming effect and may sometimes be included within antacid medications . Many of the common antacids also include alginates . Most alginates work by forming a gel which floats on top of the stomach contents .

Surgery involves either making holes in the skull ( called burr holes ) or an operation called a craniotomy . Burr holes are small holes that are drilled through the skull over the area where the subdural haematoma has formed . They allow the blood to be removed or sucked out through the holes . Stitches or staples are then used to close the incision . A craniotomy entails a portion of the skull being removed so that the brain and meninges are exposed .

The only way to effectively treat dead or dying pulp is to remove it .

Your dentist should advise you of this risk before commencing certain procedures - for example , when preparing a tooth for a crown or placing a very deep filling . Orthodontic treatment can also cause pulp death if braces are tightened too quickly .

Molar teeth on the other hand can have 3 to 6 canals which are smaller , are harder to access at the back of the mouth and can be curved or even ' S'-shaped . Some root canals can also be blocked by layers of dentine which makes treatment more difficult . The cause of the pulp death / damage - a tooth that has been fractured in a sporting injury may have little or no pulp infection and might undergo RCT in a single appointment .

This is achieved by placing a special layer of material , which promotes the formation of new dentine , on top of the exposed pulp before placing a filling . This technique is called a direct pulp cap . Alternatively , if only the exposed part of the pulp appears to be infected or inflamed then just the top half of the pulp can be removed , from within the pulp chamber .

Fewer than 2 in 100 women who fall pregnant after previously having a hydatidiform mole will develop another hydatidiform mole in a subsequent pregnancy . Rarely , GTD can be ' reactivated ' after a future pregnancy even several years later . For this reason , your hCG levels should be monitored for a time after any pregnancy ends ( be it a normal pregnancy , a miscarriage , a termination , etc ) .

For severe strains ( badly torn muscles or tendons ) , surgery is used very rarely - usually only if there is a complete tear in which the muscle is completely torn or has become unattached to the bone ( for example , a severe hamstring injury ) .

The combination of taking combined hormonal contraception plus having migraine with aura increases the stroke risk by a little more than this , multiplying it by 2 to 4 . This is still a very low risk , but it is an increased risk of something very serious . Doctors therefore advise against using combined hormonal contraception if you experience migraine with aura , as this is puts you at a small but unnecessarily increased risk of something very serious .,"

Along with dissociation , some people have speculated that DID can be induced or worsened in susceptible people by hypnosis and suggestion . This may even be at the hands of an inexperienced psychotherapist . Many people who do not have symptoms of DID can have a feeling that they have lots of different parts to their personalities ; for example a critical , parental part or a timid little child part .

In the UK , because of the long - term nature of therapy for DID , NHS therapy is not always available . For this reason , people sometimes turn to private therapists . When choosing a private therapist , it is important to find someone who is familiar with DID and knows how to work with it . Not all therapists have the right kind of experience .

It is important that the therapist does not encourage greater autonomy for the dissociated identities . This can result in more separation rather than integration of identities . With a skilled therapist and a committed client , personality integration is possible , through gentle and careful unpicking of traumatic experiences . The final phase of therapy - that of integration and rehabilitation - prepares the client for the end of therapy . This too can take some time . After working closely with a therapist , saying goodbye and moving forward need preparation . It can feel daunting .

Some believed that it could increase the characteristics of the dissociated identities , worsening DID symptoms . Evidence seems to suggest that this is not that case . If fact , working in the right way with identities can help to reduce distressing symptoms . Treatment for DID can be challenging and time - consuming .

If you are feeling tired and sleepy , there is also a tendency towards automatic behaviour ( doing something without really thinking about it and without having any memory of it ) . For example , you may be driving and you may drive to a different , or the wrong , destination . You might write something unsuitable , or you might say something out of context in a conversation . With this automatic behaviour , there is an increased chance that tasks that you are performing go wrong and this can lead to accidents . Sleepiness can also lead to problems with your memory and ability to concentrate . You may notice problems with your vision such as blurred or double vision . Weight gain also seems to be more common in people with narcolepsy .,"

Your level of sleepiness the next day can also be measured using a test called the multiple sleep latency test . This test looks at how long it takes for you to fall asleep during the daytime . It is usual for people with narcolepsy to fall asleep very quickly when they are asked to try to take a nap . Sometimes other tests may be done to confirm narcolepsy , or to rule out other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness . These can include the measurement of the levels of the chemical hypocretin in the fluid that bathes your brain and spinal cord ( your cerebrospinal fluid ) . A lumbar puncture is done to collect the fluid . ( A needle is pushed through the skin and tissues between two bones of your spine ( vertebrae ) into the space around the spinal cord which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid . ) See separate leaflet called Lumbar Puncture for more details .

For example , informing schoolteachers may help to explain your child 's behaviour at school and get them any extra help that they may need . As an adult , explaining your diagnosis to your work colleagues and to your boss can also help them to understand . Some people arrange with their employer or school to include scheduled naps into their work or school routine . You may also find career counselling helpful .

However , in all cases CVS was carried out before 10 completed weeks of pregnancy . Later studies showed that the risks of such problems after CVS were no higher than the risk in the general population ( ie in those pregnancies where the woman had not had CVS ) . Even so , CVS before 10 completed weeks of pregnancy is now not recommended . This is also because of the fact that CVS is more difficult to carry out at this stage of pregnancy . If your blood group is rhesus negative and the baby 's blood group is rhesus positive , there is a risk that you may develop small proteins called antibodies against the baby 's blood cells after CVS . These antibodies can attack the red blood cells of the baby , a condition called rhesus disease . So , if you are rhesus negative , you will be advised to have an injection with anti - D immunoglobulin after CVS so as to help to prevent this .,"

When calcium levels decrease , this stimulates the parathyroid gland to release parathyroid hormone . Parathyroid hormone encourages the normal process of bone breakdown ( essential for maintenance and growth of the bone ) . This process of bone breakdown releases calcium into the bloodstream . These actions raise calcium levels and counteract the effects of calcitonin . By having two hormones with opposing actions , the level of calcium in the blood can be carefully regulated . Parathyroid hormone also acts on the kidneys . Here it slows down the amount of calcium and magnesium filtered from the blood into the urine .

For more information see separate leaflet called Slipped ( Prolapsed ) Disc . As we get older our spinal discs begin to shrink . The disc dries out and does n't absorb shocks as well . Over a period of time this degeneration can be aggravated by sports and our daily activities . Injuries to our back can also cause the discs to degenerate more quickly . There is very little blood supply to the disc . So , once a disc is injured it can not repair itself and the disc can start to deteriorate . Nearly everyone has some signs of wear and tear of the spinal discs as they get older . Almost everyone older than 60 years has some degeneration of the discs , but not all people with disc degeneration will have back pain . In some cases , the discs may collapse completely and cause the facet joints in the vertebrae to rub against one another . This causes arthritis of the facet joints .,"

This is because the surgery may have weakened the ligaments , pelvic floor muscles and other support structures for the pelvic organs . However , with new advances in surgical techniques , including keyhole ( laparoscopic ) surgery , this is becoming less of a problem .

If you have a cold sore and wear lenses you should think about leaving the lenses out until the sore has resolved . If leaving them in you should only touch your eyes after thorough hand washing , to avoid transferring the virus to your eye .,"

This is the difference between osmolality and osmolarity . The osmolarity of a fluid is a measure of the number of particles per litre of the liquid that they are dissolved in ( the solute ) . The number of particles is measured in millimoles , which is another measurement widely used in chemistry . The measurement is given in millimoles per litre , or mmol / L for short . Osmolarity will change depending on the temperature of the liquid . To take the same example as above , if you dissolve 100 g of salt in 1 kg of water , the osmolarity will decrease very slightly as the liquid warms up . This is because the same weight of water takes up slightly more room as it warms up - it expands . Because osmolarity changes with temperature , the term osmolality is preferred in medicine .,"

If you fracture your hip , the doctors will usually try to work out why you may have fallen . Any underlying problem may need to be treated . Hip fracture can also occur in younger people . In these cases , it is more likely to be caused by trauma such as a car crash or a fall from a significant height .

This is to make sure that you are as fit as possible before you have any operation , and also to look for reasons why you may have fallen . Occasionally , a hip fracture can not be seen on a standard X - ray . If you have hip pain and have fallen , the doctors will want to be certain that you have not broken your hip . You may therefore be offered a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , which gives more detailed information about the hip joint and soft tissue around it .

If the patient is not fit for surgery ( for example , if they are very old or frail or have other serious medical conditions ) then regular visits to an ear specialist will be recommended .

Most of the symptoms of scabies are due to your immune system 's response to the mites , or to their saliva , their eggs or their poo ( faeces ) . In other words , the rash and the itching are mostly caused by your body 's allergic - like reaction to the mites , rather than the mites themselves . The average number of mites on an infested person is 12 .,"

However , just in case , it is best to treat bedding and towels by hot washing ( described later ) . Scabies is fairly common and can usually be recognised and treated by GPs . In the UK , about 1 in 1,000 people develop scabies each month . Scabies is more common in town ( urban ) areas , in women and children and in the winter because people often share beds in the cold . It is common worldwide , particularly where there is poverty and overcrowding such as poor areas of Asia and Africa . There may be outbreaks in overcrowded places such as refugee camps .

An outbreak in an institution with many vulnerable people , such as a nursing home , can be extremely challenging . It is likely that all residents and all staff would require treatment .

Scabies can worsen the symptoms of other skin conditions , particularly itchy skin problems such as eczema , or problems such as psoriasis . Scabies can be more difficult to diagnose in these situations too . Note : the itch and rash of scabies are due to a reaction ( allergy ) to the mites ( or their saliva , poo ( faeces ) or eggs ) . Scabies symptoms usually take 2 - 6 weeks to occur after you are first infected . The itch and rash can develop on any part of the skin , away from where the mites are actually burrowing .

This is because your skin reacts to the mites and takes a while to settle down , even once the mites have been killed . Also , even after successful treatment , in a small number of cases there remain some itchy brownish - red lumps ( nodules ) up to 2 cm in diameter . If these remain , they most commonly occur on the genitals and armpits . These lumps are neither infectious , nor mean that the mite is still present .

Irreversible pulpitis : the inflammation and damage within the pulp is too extensive for the pulp to survive even with prompt dental treatment . Tooth decay ( dental caries ) is the most common cause of pulpitis . When we eat sugary food and drinks , the bacteria in our mouths consume the sugar and release acid . Over time the acid can dissolve a hole in the enamel layer of our teeth which allows the bacteria and their toxins to enter the softer layer of dentine and pass through it to irritate the pulp . A side - effect of pulpitis is an increase in blood pressure around the nerves within the pulp .

Sinusitis : the roots of upper back teeth can be closely related to the air spaces - sinuses - in the upper jaw on either side of the nose .

If this is the case then recurrent miscarriages can happen . Hormone problems . Lack of hormones needed for pregnancy may be involved in some cases . A condition called hyperprolactinaemia , and low thyroid hormone levels ( hypothyroidism ) , can affect hormones needed to maintain pregnancy . Low progesterone levels in the early stages of pregnancy may affect the way the developing baby embeds ( implants ) in the womb . Lifestyle factors . It may be that factors such as smoking , drinking excessive alcohol regularly or being very overweight contribute to the likelihood of having miscarriages . Evidence is not yet clear how important these factors are .,"

The two surgical groups , whether tissue was removed or not , did a bit better than no treatment but not enough to consider surgery to be more effective . It has been suggested that the slight benefit of both ASD and ' sham ' surgery might be due to the physiotherapy following the operation or to a placebo effect . Calcific tendonitis - ' ultrasound - guided barbotage ' may be performed . This involves injecting the calcium deposit with salt water and sucking it out through a syringe .

A varicocele may ( rarely ) develop if there is a blockage of larger veins higher in the tummy ( abdomen ) . This puts back - pressure on the smaller veins in the scrotum which then enlarge ( dilate ) . This is only likely to occur in men older than 40 .

If a large varicocele develops in a teenager , the testis on the side of the varicocele may not develop as much as would be expected .

Elsewhere in the world , other viruses can cause encephalitis after bites by insects such as mosquitoes ( Japanese B encephalitis virus , West Nile virus ) or ticks ( Central European tick - borne virus ) . Sometimes encephalitis can develop with rabies virus infection after an animal bite . Most cases of encephalitis are caused by the virus directly infecting the brain . However , sometimes encephalitis can develop if your immune system tries to fight off a virus and , at the same time , attacks the nerves in your brain in error .

Sometimes this is several times during the night as well as many times during the day . Some women also find that they leak urine during sex , especially during orgasm . The cause of urinary urgency and urge incontinence is not fully understood . The bladder muscle seems to become overactive and squeeze ( contract ) when you do n't want it to . This is the second most common cause of urinary incontinence . The rest of this leaflet discusses the use of medicines to treat urinary urgency , stress incontinence and urge incontinence .

These medicines work by blocking certain nerve impulses to the bladder which relax the bladder muscle , so increasing the bladder capacity . Other medicines which are used less often are oestrogen gels / creams applied to the vagina , or a medicine called desmopressin . A medicine called mirabegron is another option sometimes used to treat urge incontinence . It works by stimulating beta3 receptors in the bladder . This has the effect of relaxing the bladder muscles . In the past other medicines ( for example , propantheline and tricyclic antidepressants ) were used to treat urge incontinence ; however , they are not used any longer because of their side - effects . Duloxetine is available as oral capsules . Antimuscarinics are available as capsules , tablets or skin patches . Some antimuscarinic tablets are available as slow - release tablets or capsules .

This is because you can have withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness , feeling sick ( nausea ) and headaches . For antimuscarinics , a common plan is to try a course of medication for a month or so . If it is helpful , you may be advised to continue for up to six months or so and then stop the medication to see how symptoms are without the medication . Symptoms may return after you finish a course of medication . If you combine a course of medication with bladder training , the long - term outlook ( prognosis ) is better and symptoms may be less likely to return when you stop the medication .

Insert a small tube ( stent ) into a narrowed ureter . This helps the flow of urine if there is a narrowing . Perform a special X - ray of the ureters and kidneys . A doctor can inject a dye into the ureters up towards the kidney . This shows up on X - ray pictures and helps to show problems of the kidney or ureter .

It may last longer if the doctor does a procedure - for example , taking a sample ( biopsy ) from the lining of the bladder . The cystoscope is then gently pulled out . Your doctor may tell you what they saw inside your bladder straight after the test . If you had a biopsy taken , the sample is sent away to be tested and looked at under a microscope . It can take several days for the report of the biopsy to come back to the doctor . In some cases a general anaesthetic is given when a cystoscopy is done , particularly if a rigid cystoscope is used . In some cases a spinal anaesthetic is given which numbs all the lower half of the body .,"

Therefore , they are not a useful long - term treatment for phobias . A short course , or even a single dose , may be prescribed for a phobia which occurs rarely ; however , there is no evidence to support this practice .

If you have CTG before you are in labour you may be asked to press a button on the machine every time the baby moves . At this time you will not be having any contractions so the CTG will only monitor the baby 's heart rate .

These include ' open book ' fractures , when the pelvis is broken at the front and the back by severe force from the front , and lateral ( or sideways ) force fractures which often fracture the pubic rami and the sacroiliac joints , sometimes also involving the hip socket . Pelvic fractures , whether stable or unstable , can also be divided into ' open ' fractures , in which injuries to the skin mean that the broken bones are visible , or ' closed ' fractures , in which the skin is not broken .
