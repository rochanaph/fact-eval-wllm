        "watermarked_text": "machines are thought to work in two ways : On a high pulse rate of 90 - 130 Hz ( the normal method of use ) , the electrical impulses are likely to function through a neural stimulation of the muscles involved directly without the use of neurohematic secretions . This results in a muscle shortening with subsequent increase in volume of the muscle, an increase in tension and subsequently a contraction of the muscle. On a low pulse rate of about 23 (the normal method of application), these implants will act on the muscle by the secretions, as it was shown above, while a combination of secretions and electrical stimulation is obtained at a medium pulse rate . This electrical stimulation of muscles is accompanied by physiologically induced fatigue of the muscles that are stimulated by the electrical impulse; at low impulse rates, this fatigue is much higher than the impulse rate such as when it was used at a low pulse at about 20\u201325 per second, as suggested by El-Sayed . This fatigue could explain the beneficial effect of the implants at low pulse rates.",

On a low pulse ( 1 - 40 Hz ) they cause a decrease in contraction of muscle tissue . This reduction is reversed when the current is stopped. This fact can potentially be used in the treatment of spasticity, where a decrease in muscle contractions is desired . Theoretically, this decrease in muscle activity could be caused by peripheral nerve blockade or blockade of motor endplates . The former seems to be more likely, because low-frequency stimulation ( LFS ) evokes hypercontraction after stopping the current. This is in contrast to muscle relaxation after peripheral nerve injury . This phenomenon does not arise in the same manner with high-frequency stimulations .

This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain . When the machine is set on a low pulse rate ( 2 - 5 Hz ) it stimulates the body to make its own pain - easing chemicals called endorphins . These act a bit like morphine to block pain signals .,"

This may be why we can have a subjective \u2018I\u2019 whose characteristics appear to change during the course of learning, e.g. feeling like a different person when running; in contrast with the idea that in early modern philosophy, the \u2018I\u2019 was identified with a substance, an immaterial soul, or a body [51, 69, 84]. I suggest that in this view experience emerges as a function of repeated and modifiable interactions.

We may not be able to hop for several reasons, or to make the music we wish to play. Yet the doing of the activity in its fullest ideal form has not been completely abandoned. Doing it at its ideal best is what the child hopes to be able to achieve, and it is why he seeks lessons and exercises and training. It is why the child, too, wants to know where he is and what is and how he should behave, and what is truth. Such a vision motivates learning; it is not learned itself as a result that motivates .

The truth is that unless the question is asked in exactly the same way , different surveys will give different results. Despite their faults it would seem that national opinion polls are still widely consulted in this country and can have an obvious influence on government policy . Moreover, since there are limitations to the use of polls one might reasonably conclude that the overall benefit gained from their use outweighs the disadvantages. They can perhaps serve as rough barometers showing at least which policies are likely to prove popular with the general public and so might be omitted. It would seem that one of the reasons for their longevity is that politicians can learn from a relatively simple technique, which, though prone to human error is still likely to remain valid from one day to the next. Another example is where we have to make a choice involving a degree of uncertainty. For example, if asked \u201cis there a God?\u201d, the answer can be either yes or no.

However, given the large number (>30) of known human viruses and many unknown viruses out there, physicians may find that a large portion of different known viruses are able to cause similar symptoms (eg., pneumonia, fever, runny nose). This makes diagnosis a difficult task due in part to the physician's lack of experience with many viruses. However, there has been little effort to objectively evaluate how these factors lead to human misdiagnoses of symptoms which in some cases might mean the difference between life and death. Accordingly, we formulate this question: can we develop an objective method to analyze and quantitatively compare",

If the level of thyroxine in the blood is low , then the pituitary releases more TSH to try to stimulate the thyroid gland to make more thyroxine . Therefore , a raised level of TSH means the thyroid gland is underactive and is not making enough thyroxine . Thyroxine . A low level of thyroxine confirms hypothyroidism . Other tests are not usually necessary unless a rare cause of hypothyroidism is suspected . For example , tests of the pituitary gland may be done if both the TSH and thyroxine levels are low . Some people have a raised TSH level but have a normal thyroxine level . This means that you are making enough thyroxine but the thyroid gland is needing extra stimulation from TSH to make the required amount of thyroxine . In this situation you have an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism in the future . Your doctor may advise a repeat blood test every so often to see if you do eventually develop hypothyroidism .,"

If possible, breathing in through the nose helps to make breathing easier.A diaphragmatic breathing : breathe deeply through your nose. Breathe in completely; this way your stomach should move and your chest should become bigger. Exhale completely, through your open mouth, while making a sound like \u201ceeee\u201d or \u201cwhooooo\u201d. This can help your lungs to empty all air. Breathing using the chest and back only is not very efficient.Paced breathing. You inhale and exhale during a count of four.

To this effect, that the ventricles do not receive impulses before all parts of the atrium depolarized, or until anatomical and functional factors have altered the impulse strength . This is part of the normal process for impulses pass through the heart. The ventricles then contract quickly (about a fifth to a sixth of a second after a heart beat ), causing the blood to eject. The above sequence of events is represented schematically . After the end of the contraction, there is a period of rest, or recovery, of the heart. This recovery period is required to allow for a new impulse (a new heart beat ) to initiate, while also ensuring adequate heart function. The heart is refractory during relaxation, or recovery. These terms refer to the incapacity of heart cells to resume an electrical action while still conducting a prior one. A normal or good heart retains this ability (a property",

If there is no AV block the impulse then gets through the AV node, via the His\u2010Purkinje system into the ventricular tissues, causing the heart to contract. However due to the AV block there is a delay in this phase ( see Fig. 8 ). The main problem caused by even this mild type of AV block is that the ventricles do not contract enough in order to pump the blood hard enough up through the pulmonary artery to the lungs ( where there is increased pulmonary pressure ). This results in elevated pressure in the right ventricle leading to the development of what is diagnosed as pulmonary hypertension. This is a progressive pathological process, resulting frequently in what is termed as end\u2010stage right ventricular failure. This can lead to the closing of the tricuspid (right atrioventicular) valve to form a ' dead heart ' and this can lead to either death or",
        "natural_text": ". Most of the tissue between the atria and ventricles does not conduct the impulse . However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
