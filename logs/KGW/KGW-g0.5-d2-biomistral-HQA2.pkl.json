As far as definitive treatment for this rare syndrome is concerned, there are no particular therapies proven to alleviate signs and symptoms observed in patients. Medical therapies tend to focus on reducing or preventing seizures and ensuring normal development of the brain by providing neuropsychiatric therapies. Careful nutritional monitoring should be provided as development of obesity and other fat storage diseases are common. Genetic counseling and a treatment plan is usually given to a child diagnosed with cri du chat by the age of 4 years. Physical, Occupational, and Speech therapy should be used to allow for patient to maximize functional skills. Supportive therapies to minimize symptoms should be an important part of care for this condition as there are no therapeutics to prevent or reverse effects due to lack of p15 gene.

Usually, such complications do not indicate that some special damage had been done. Most vaccines are not given inside blood vessels, and there is little chance of damaging blood vessels accidentally. In any case, antibodies cannot enter blood vessels (they are big molecules).

Specific inquiry should be made for a detailed family history and review of their previous symptoms.

The best option is to go to the nearest clinic after cleaning the bite, where tetanus vaccine can be given and further treatment can be started. After cleaning the bite (a procedure in which a sharpened object such as a needle should be used), disinfectant solution can be applied to the area.

Response: Great question! DMD is diagnosed by finding genetic changes ( called mutations ) in a gene that makes a protein called dystrophin. A doctor may suggest testing for DMD if a child has signs or symptoms, such as having trouble breathing or climbing stairs or if a male child has enlarged muscles. Once the diagnosis is made, other types of tests such as heart testing or skeletal muscle testing may also be needed. Dystrophins are an important part of the skeletal and cardiac muscles in our body. The genetic changes (or mutations) that affect the dystrohins are responsible for the disorder called DMD. All men who have this disease and inherit (get) it from their mothers will be severely affected by this disorder. It occurs in about 1 in 5,000 males during infancy",
        "unwatermarked_text": "How is Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) diagnosed ? Diagnosis of DMD can be made by looking at DNA test or by muscle biopsy . Identification of DNA abnormality in the gene of dystrophin can be done by Southern blot analysis . It is a process in which the patient's DNA is cut into tiny fragments by enzymes. Those fragments are then separated according to size. The DNA segments are then hybridized to a 'complementary probes'. Those probes can be dystro-specific or generic. Dystro- specific probes are much more reliable & sensitive than generic probes. DMD is diagnosed in 99% cases by Southern analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes . Another test done by 'polymerase chain reaction', PCR is faster than Southern analysis in terms of diagnosis. It detects 98% of all dystro mutations. It only requires small amount of DNA derived from peripheral leukocyte",
        "natural_text": "The diagnosis may be suspected because of the child 's symptoms ( above ) . When looking for signs of DMD , it is important to watch the child running and getting up from the floor - the muscle weakness is more noticeable during these activities . Tests are needed before DMD can be diagnosed . The first step in making the diagnosis is a blood test . This tests for creatine kinase . Children with DMD always have a very high level of creatine kinase ( about 10 - 100 times normal ) . Therefore , if a child 's creatine kinase level is normal then DMD is ruled out . If the creatine kinase level is high , further tests are needed to see whether this is due to DMD or to some other condition . The next step in diagnosing DMD involves either a muscle biopsy and/or genetic tests : A muscle biopsy involves taking a small sample of a muscle , under local anaesthetic . The sample is examined under a microscope using special techniques to look at the muscle fibres and the dystrophin protein . Genetic tests are done using a blood sample . The DNA in the blood is tested to look at the dystrophin gene . This test can diagnose most cases of DMD .,"

One article focused on job satisfaction  and the other on employment and underemployment . These articles were published in a supplement focused on employment and disability. The publications in this supplement can all be accessed online, thanks to the efforts of the editor who contacted the authors and requested scans of the original publication. All have been converted to PDF and accessible through the Web of Science.

The pathogenesis of BPPV may be explained by the translocation of calcium carbonate particles, otoliths, through the semi-circular canals which cause a stimulation of the vestibular receptors and produce vertigo . The otolith particles are believed to belong to degenerated loose bodies formed at the end of the otic capsule and normally floating freely within the ipsilateral utricle (of Endolymph) without any disturbance of balance .

These symptoms may occur spontaneously or after certain changes in the body's position, particularly when lying down or tilting the head backward. The symptoms of BPPV are caused by a misdirected sensation that the brain receives from the inner ear. During a misplaced movement of the otoliths, the crystals move from their regular position in the inner ear to an area closer to the nerve endings.

The bronchoscope ( often shortened to ' scope ' ) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and carry out the procedure . Endobronchial means from inside or within the bronchus . The bronchi ( the plural of bronchus ) are large tube - like airways . They take air from the windpipe ( trachea ) to the smaller airways , called the bronchioles . During the procedure ultrasound is used to help the doctor doing the test see the structures just outside the airways . This gives the test the first part of its name . The scope also contains a very fine needle . This needle is used to take samples of body tissue by pushing through the bronchus to the tissue on the other side . The needle holds the sample of tissue ; this is called aspiration . Transbronchial means across the bronchus , giving the name transbronchial needle aspiration .,"
