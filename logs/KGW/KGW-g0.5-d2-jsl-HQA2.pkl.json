It's more common in females and can cause complications such as hemorrhages. The condition is characterized by recurring nosebleeds but patients may also experience bleeding in other parts of the body. There are no specific treatment options available for this disease, but symptomatic managements are provided to manage the nosebleeds. The inheritance pattern of this syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means that having one parent with the condition puts the child at 50% risk of inheriting it. However, there may be cases with autosomal recessive or sporadic patterns as well. Despite the symptoms, most patients lead normal lives and only require occasional medical attention for nosebleeds or other bleeding issues.

By understanding the heart's electrical system and how afib disrupts it, you can better appreciate why managing this condition is crucial. To simplify things, let's break them down individually.\nThe heart's electrical pathways:\nThe heart has specialized cells in each atrium (the upper chambers) and ventricle (the lower chambers) that control its rhythm. These cells create electrical impulses to coordinate contractions and ensure the heart beats in a specific pattern. The sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the heart's natural pacemaker, is responsible for generating the electrical signal that initiates each heartbeat. From there, the electrical impulses follow specific pathways, including the atrioventricular (AV) node and the bundle of His, before completing the circuit through Purkinje fibers to cause the ventricles to contract.\nAtrial fibrilation",

The healing time frame can vary, depending on factors like the severity of the fracture, how well the bone is positioned during the healing process, and any complications that may arise.  1 The bone forms a callus, which is a specialized type of connective tissue that fills in the gap where the bone was broken. 2 Over time, the callus hardens and is eventually replaced with mature bone tissue. 3 Factors that can delay healing include poor circulation, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or poor nutrition. 4 To promote healing, it's important to keep the toe immobilized, avoid putting pressure or weight on it, maintain good circulation, and take care of your overall health. 1, 2, 3, 4  5 In some cases, a cast or boot may be needed to keep the broken toe in proper alignment during the healing",

Technically it is called chronic open - angle glaucoma ( COAG ) , chronic glaucoma or primary open - angle glaucoma . COAG develops slowly and painlessly , so that any damage to the optic nerve and loss of sight are gradual and you may not notice anything has changed until the condition is very advanced . The term ' open - angle ' refers to the angle formed in the eye between the outer edge of the iris and sclera . In COAG this is normal , whereas in acute angle - closure glaucoma , which is a much less common condition , it is narrowed or blocked off .

        "watermarked_text": "How is Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) diagnosed? DMD is usually suspected in children who have a family history of the condition and are showing signs of muscle weakness or developmental delay. The diagnosis is typically confirmed through a combination of medical and genetic tests, including a detailed medical history and physical examination, muscle enzyme tests, genetic testing for mutations in the dystrophin gene, and imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI to evaluate muscle structure and function. #### Why is it important to diagnose Duchenne muscular d y steropia ( DMD) early? Early diagnosis of DMD is crucial for several reasons : 1. It allows for early treatment and intervention, which can help delay the progression of the disease and improve overall quality of life. 2. Early diagnosis enables families to plan for future needs and make decisions about healthcare and support services. 3. Identification of the genetic mutation responsible for DMD can help guide genetic counseling and enable family members to understand their risk of passing on the condition. 4. Early detection can help identify individuals",

Other tests like creatine kinase (CK) levels, muscle biopsy, and genetic testing are often used for confirmation of the diagnosis. Additionally, a physical examination, medical history, and family history can provide further insights into the diagnosis. - The diagnosis of DMD is largely based on the clinical presentation and history of the patient, including muscle weakness, delayed development of motor skills, and early loss of ambulation. - Genetic testing, such as DNA sequencing, is also used to confirm the presence of mutations in the dystrophin gene. - A muscle biopsy is performed to examine the muscle tissue for changes associated with DMD, including the absence of dystrophin. - Western blot analysis is another diagnostic tool used to detect the absence of intact dystrophin in the patient\u2019s blood. - Elevated levels of",
        "natural_text": "The diagnosis may be suspected because of the child 's symptoms ( above ) . When looking for signs of DMD , it is important to watch the child running and getting up from the floor - the muscle weakness is more noticeable during these activities . Tests are needed before DMD can be diagnosed . The first step in making the diagnosis is a blood test . This tests for creatine kinase . Children with DMD always have a very high level of creatine kinase ( about 10 - 100 times normal ) . Therefore , if a child 's creatine kinase level is normal then DMD is ruled out . If the creatine kinase level is high , further tests are needed to see whether this is due to DMD or to some other condition . The next step in diagnosing DMD involves either a muscle biopsy and/or genetic tests : A muscle biopsy involves taking a small sample of a muscle , under local anaesthetic . The sample is examined under a microscope using special techniques to look at the muscle fibres and the dystrophin protein . Genetic tests are done using a blood sample . The DNA in the blood is tested to look at the dystrophin gene . This test can diagnose most cases of DMD .,"

It is unlikely to do any permanent damage but it may take longer for your normal voice to return . Resting the voice means not shouting , singing or talking for long periods . Quiet conversation is usually fine . A sighing soft speech is best rather than whispering until the laryngitis has gone . This is because whispering makes your voice box ( larynx ) work harder than soft sighing speech . Once you can hum comfortably , you can probably start talking normally again . If you are a performer such as a singer , it can be a difficult decision as to when to start singing again . Singing too early , when symptoms are easing , may prolong the hoarse voice longer than if you rest it fully until symptoms have completely gone . There is no easy answer as to the earliest it is safe to sing without doing any more harm .

        "unwatermarked_text": "Why are premature babies at risk of intraventricular haemorrhage? The reason for premature babies being at risk of Intraventricular Haemorrhage (IVH) can be attributed to several factors. One of the main reasons is the immaturity of their brain tissue and blood vessels. Premature babies have underdeveloped brains, which makes them more susceptible to bleeding. Furthermore, their blood vessels are fragile and prone to rupture due to the thinness of their walls. This is because the blood vessels in the brains of premature babies are still developing and have not yet reached full maturity. Additionally, the stress of delivery, both physical and physiological, can exacerbate the risks of IVH in these vulnerable infants. Lastly, factors such as infections, blood clotting disorders, and oxygen deprivation can also contribute to the development of IVH. Overall, the combination of brain immaturity, fragile blood vessels, and external stressors makes premature babies more susceptible to intraventricuar haemorrhages.

Answer: Usual Tests Include: - Non-Contrast CT Scan of the Brain: This is the most commonly used test to confirm the diagnosis of IVH. - MRI of the Brain : This test may also be ordered to assess for other injuries to the brain. - Blood Tests: These are done to check for any underlying bleeding disorders that may have caused the IVH. 6. What are the Common Causes of Intraventricilar Haemorrhages in newborns? Answer: Common Causes May Include: - High Blood Pressure in The Mother: This can cause the blood to be abnormally pressured and lead to bleeding in the baby's brain after birth. - Bleeding Disorders: These are conditions where the blood does not clot properly, making it susceptible to bleeding. - Stroke: A blockage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain can cause bleeding, and in newborns this can be due to birth trauma, clots in the blood vessels or narrowing of the blood vessels.

It is often referred to as aero-otitis media. It occurs due to changes in air pressure during ascent and descent in an aircraft. This pressure can cause the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the throat, to become blocked. When the tube is blocked, fluid from the middle ear cannot escape and the pressure inside the ear builds up, leading to pain, discomfort, and sometimes a feeling of fullness in the ear. The pain may be mild to severe and can affect one or both ears.

        "watermarked_text": "What can be done for Setting Back Prominent Ears? Here are several options that can help improve the appearance of setting back prominent ears: 1. Batlle Ear Pinning: This is the most common technique used to set back prominent ears. In this procedure, the surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and moves the cartilage and skin forward while adjusting the tissue to create a more natural fold. 2. Cartilage Trim: For more severe cases of protruding ears, the surgeon may need to trim excess cartilage from the outer ear to reduce its size and prominence. 3. Non-Surgical Options: There are also non-surgical alternatives available, such as using small gel-filled implants that help to fill out the ear, providing a more natural appearance. These implants are inserted under local anesthesia and can last several years before needing replacement. 4. Otoplasty Surgery: This procedure is generally recommended for children, as the cartilage in the ears is more pliable at this age. During otoplasty surgery, an",

Reconstructive ear surgery is typically performed to correct functional issues, such as hearing loss or discharge, while cosmetic ear surgery focuses on improving the appearance of the ears without addressing any underlying medical concerns. In cases of prominent ears, both approaches may be used to achieve the desired outcome.

Pinnaplasty or otoplasty is an operation which adjusts the shape of the cartilage within the ear to create the missing folds and to allow the ear to lie closer to the side of the head . Because the operation is carried out from behind the ears , a small scar is left close to the groove between the ear and the side of the head .

They centre on whether there is bony tenderness at certain points around the ankle . If there is no bony tenderness in any of these points AND you are able to weight bear ( both in casualty when seen and immediately after the injury ) then fracture is unlikely and you will not need to be X - rayed . If , however , any of those features ARE present then an X - ray will be offered in order to detect or rule out fracture .,"
