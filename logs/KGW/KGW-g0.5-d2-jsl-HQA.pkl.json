The second way these machines are reputed to work is on a lower pulse rate, 13 - 26 Hz in particular. At this pulse rate, the electrical nerve current is said to induce a sustained muscle contraction. The prolonged contractions supposedly allow for greater blood flow and increase the sensitivity of the stimulated area ( Hodge, 1976, pp. 29, 35 ).

The machine is adjusted so that the intensity of the electrical pulses is comfortable but not painful. The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated, but typically 15 - 30 minutes is sufficient. Treatments can be carried out daily for as long as needed.\nWhile TENS is generally safe and well - tolerated when used as directed, there are some contraindications. These include :\n1.

This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain . When the machine is set on a low pulse rate ( 2 - 5 Hz ) it stimulates the body to make its own pain - easing chemicals called endorphins . These act a bit like morphine to block pain signals .,"

Dyspraxia is a developmental disorder, which means that it affects the way the parts of the nervous system that control movements develop. The exact cause of dyspraxia isn't known, although both genetic and environmental factors may play a role. Many children with dyspraxias are also described as having a specific learning difficulty. The good news is that there are strategies that can help manage dyspraxic difficulties and enable children to achieve their full potential. These strategies include multi-sensory teaching approaches, breaking down tasks into smaller steps, providing extra time for tasks, and making use of assistive technology. With support and understanding, children with dyslexia or dyspraxria can thrive and succeed in all areas of life.

Every time we perform the skill, connections between our nerves are strengthened, making it easier to perform the action the next time. With enough practice, our nerve connections become very good at this particular task, and the skill becomes a habit or automatic response. This is why it often takes a long time to learn complex skills like playing a musical instrument or riding a bicycle. Our nervous system has to make many connections to coordinate all the different parts involved in these activities.\nSometimes, our nervous system may not form the connections we need to learn a skill quickly or easily. This can be due to various factors, including genes, injury, or lack of practice. In such cases, it is important to be patient and keep trying.

To give the impression that different surveys are being used to predict the same outcome is a bit like holding a mirror up to your face and pretending the reflection is someone else.\nThere is an important principle in polling called the'margin of error '. This is essentially a measure of how confident we can be that the result obtained is accurate. In simple terms, if the margin of error is plus or minus 3%, then the true result could be 3% above or 3% below the result obtained in the survey. Some surveys have lower margins of error than others, depending on factors such as sample size and how good their sampling method is.

This can look like a neuroma and can lead to compression of the nerve . The anatomy of the bones of the foot is also thought to contribute to the development of Morton 's neuroma . For example , the space between the long bones ( metatarsals ) in the foot is narrower between the second and third and between the third and fourth metatarsals . This means that the nerves that run between these metatarsals are more likely to be compressed and irritated . Wearing narrow shoes can make this compression worse . Sometimes , other problems can contribute to the compression of the nerve . These include the growth of a fatty lump ( called a lipoma ) and also the formation of a fluid - filled sac that can form around a joint ( a bursa ) .

There are similarities between these conditions in terms of the way the brain processes thoughts and emotions. Some theories suggest that BDD may be related to an imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain that affect mood and behavior, such as serotonin and dopamine. Genetic factors may also play a role, as BDD can run in families. Other factors that may contribute to the development of BDD include : - Body dissatisfaction : Many people with BDD have a strong desire for their bodies to look differently. - Trauma : Some individuals with BDD may have experienced some form of childhood trauma or abuse. - Family history : BDD can sometimes run in families, suggesting a genetic component. - Psychological factors : BDD often involves negative self - evaluation and intrusive thinking about one's physical appearance. - Environmental factors : Societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards may also contribute to the condition.

This occurs because the blood circulates through the entire body, and as it moves, it delivers hormones to the cells throughout the body that need them. The effects of hormones are usually long-lasting, as they can influence cells for hours, days, or even years after they are released into the bloodstream.

Many hormones have specific targets in the body, but some hormones act on a wider range of tissues. For example, growth hormone acts on almost all the cells in the body. 3. Hormones are often involved in controlling events in the body that happen over a longer period of time, such as growth and development, metabolism, and the reproductive cycle. 4. Hormones can be produced by different types of glands in the body: endocrine glands, exocrine glands, and other structures that are not typically considered glands. 5. The release of hormones is usually regulated by a negative feedback system, where the hormone itself has an effect on the gland that produces it, either increasing or decreasing its production. 6.

In the case of angina, the lack of blood flow is in the heart muscle, preventing it from getting enough oxygen and nutrients. This usually occurs when the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart are narrowed, often due to a buildup of fatty deposits called plaques.\nThe heart muscle doesn't have its own blood supply, so it relies on these coronary arteries to get oxygen-rich blood. When the flow of blood is restricted, the heart muscle can't get the oxygen it needs, which can lead to chest pain, also known as angina.

It clears very slowly.\nThe middle ear is connected to the throat at its back, forming a tube called the Eustachian tube. This tube is meant to equalize the air pressure in the middle ear with the air pressure outside. However, due to its anatomy, this tube is not efficient in patients with a cleft palate or other palatal abnormalities. This means that the air pressure differences cause the eardrum to become retracted, further impairing its function. The ventilation of the middle ear is crucial for it to work well. The Eustach ( say 'YOO-stash') tube connects the middle ear to the throat and helps to equalize air pressure, but in cleft palate patients, it does not always work properly. This leads to problems with the eardrums and can result in hearing difficulties. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to create a bypass for the ventilation of the ear, allowing better hearing.

It clears up in time, but the damage is done. In this context,'sensorineural hearing loss'is a misnomer, as it implies the hair cells in the inner ear are not functioning properly. If the fluid in the inner-ear can be cleared promptly, the sensorineural component could be reversible, meaning the hair cells could regain their normal function. However, if the fluid remains for too long, it may cause permanent damage to the delicate structures of the inner ear. In summary, the term'sensorineural hearing\nloss'is not accurate in this situation because it implies hair cell dysfunction, which is not the case in a sudden attack of glue ear. The correct term would be'secretory otitis media'or'serous otitis media,' indicating that the cause is the secreted glue-like fluid rather than hair cell dysfunction.

In fact, one study reported that the prevalence of CHE in diabetic patients was approximately 30%. This condition is characterized by dry, scaly, and itchy skin on the hands and feet, and it can significantly affect daily activities. CHE can be attributed to several factors, including increased skin dryness, peripheral neuropathy, and poor blood circulation, all of which are common in Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Elevated blood glucose levels can exacerbate these issues, leading to the development of CHE. Moreover, CHE may also represent an early manifestation of impaired glucose metabolism and may be an indicator of poor glycemic control in patients with DM.

Blood tests will typically show elevated levels of free T4 ( free thyroxine ) and possibly decreased levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Treatment often involves medications like antithyroid drugs, beta blockers, or radioactive iodine to suppress thyroid function. Hyperthyroidism can be caused by Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter, Hashitoxicosis, and various other medical conditions. It is important to work with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. It is typically diagnosed with blood tests measuring total and free thyroid hormone levels, thyroid stimulating hormone (Tsh ) levels, and occasionally, thyroid antibody levels. A low dose radioactive iodine uptake test may also",

If the level of thyroxine in the blood is low , then the pituitary releases more TSH to try to stimulate the thyroid gland to make more thyroxine . Therefore , a raised level of TSH means the thyroid gland is underactive and is not making enough thyroxine . Thyroxine . A low level of thyroxine confirms hypothyroidism . Other tests are not usually necessary unless a rare cause of hypothyroidism is suspected . For example , tests of the pituitary gland may be done if both the TSH and thyroxine levels are low . Some people have a raised TSH level but have a normal thyroxine level . This means that you are making enough thyroxine but the thyroid gland is needing extra stimulation from TSH to make the required amount of thyroxine . In this situation you have an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism in the future . Your doctor may advise a repeat blood test every so often to see if you do eventually develop hypothyroidism .,"

This acts like a'junction box'and the impulse is delayed slightly before traveling down the bundle of His, which splits into the left and right bundle branches, that lead to the ventricles. As the impulse travels through the bundle ofHis and into the ventric les, the electrical conduction becomes faster, causing the ventric Les to contract in a normal heart beat pattern. However, if there is an abnormality in the conduction system, the impulse may bypass the AV node and travel directly down through the bundleofHis and over the septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve, creating an abnormal heart rhythm called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The presence of this accessory conduction pathway may result in tachycardia and require treatment to prevent complications such as atrial fibrillation. The rest of the heart structure includes the left andright atrio ventricular (AV) valves which separate the atria from the ventricules and help to ensure one way blood flow, the papillary muscles which support the valves, the chordae",

Then it gets to the bundle of His, which is like a main electrical cable that sends the impulse downward through the ventricles dividing into two branches called the right and left bundle branches. These then transmit the impulse to stimulate the contraction of the ventricular muscles. Conduction of electrical impulses through the heart is a rapid process that normally takes less than 0.2 seconds. The electrical activity of the heart is measured by an electrocardiogram ( ECG ), which records the electrical potential changes on the body surface. This record is called an electrocardio gram. The P wave indicates atrial depolarization. The PR interval indicates the time it takes for the impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricLES. The QRS interval indicates ventricular depolarization, and the T wave indicates ventricular repolarization ( Figure 3 ). If any part of the conduction pathway is'blocked'or severely damaged, it can lead to an abnormal",

However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
