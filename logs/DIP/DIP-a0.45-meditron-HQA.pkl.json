This is because of the high negative left atrial pressure present all the time in the physiological state. The atrial muscle contraction, called atrial kick, is the main driver of ventricular ejection. It is the atrial kick which propels the blood into the closed and unobstructed arterial system. The left atrium acts as a reservoir. The ventricular cavity, during diastole, receives blood from the left atrium through the mitral valve.

It is also known as sonography, especially in medicine. It is essentially an imaging technique for mapping and studying the internal anatomy of organ systems or organs of the human or other animal body.

It is not possible to demonstrate these defects with a regular ultrasound scan. Another new method, the ultrasonic scan with integrated echo contrast agent injection (UCIDE), is a non-invasive technique used to examine foetal brain structure and movement. This procedure utilises special software packages and has found to be useful in determining the type of cerebral birth defects - namely ventriculomegaly, cerebellar malformation or hydranencephaly - and foetal age.

This is because for natural tissue healing and homeostasis of the head it is not recommended to use pain killers. To get rid of the painkillers, the best medications for this would be to try to prevent its creation in the first place by utilizing a regular sleep routine, a sleep mask that blocks out all light, anti-inflammatory diet and to perform gentle daily home massage techniques at home with hot or cold saline compresses to ease the muscle tension pain.

So , with treatment , the headaches may not go completely , but they will often develop less often and be less severe . Any headache that does occur whilst taking preventative medication may also be eased better than previously by a painkiller . It is often difficult in retrospect to say how well a preventative treatment has worked . Therefore , it is best to keep a headache diary for a couple of weeks or so before starting preventative medication . This is to record when and how severe each headache was , and also how well it was eased by a painkiller . Then , keep the diary going as you take the preventative medicine to see how well things improve . The headaches are unlikely to go completely but the diary may show a marked improvement .
