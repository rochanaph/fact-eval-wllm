They are typically started early in the course of the disease, while the patient is still experiencing active inflammation and joint damage. The goal is to slow down the progression of the disease and prevent long-term joint damage. DMARDs are also often combined with corticosteroids to provide rapid relief of symptoms and prevent joint destruction. The decision to prescribe DMARDs and the choice of specific medications are made based on the severity of the disease, patient factors, and potential side effects of the medications. In some cases, DMARDs may be initiated earlier in the disease course if there is evidence of joint damage or widespread inflammation",

It may also lead to the formation of an effusion (a collection of fluid) behind the tympanic membrane, which can lead to pain, fever, and hearing loss. In severe cases, the eardrums may even perforate (develop a hole), leading to potential hearing loss and balance problems. These complications occur when there is repeated or severe barotrauma. To prevent such complications, it is essential to manage barotraumas promptly and appropriately. Is there any treatment for Barotraum of the Ear?

The condition is characterized by recurring nosebleeds but patients may also experience bleeding in other parts of the body. There are no specific treatment options available for this disease, but symptomatic managements are provided to manage the nosebleeds. The inheritance pattern of this syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means that having one parent with the condition puts the child at 50% risk of inheriting it. However, there may be cases with autosomal recessive or sporadic patterns as well.

The primary goal is to lower the LDL cholesterol levels, as high levels of LDL are responsible for the development of atherosclerosis. However, it is also important to manage the total cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels. Statins are the mainstay of treatment in familial hypercholesterolemia, as they significantly reduce LDL cholesterol levels. Other interventions, such as diet modification, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, bile acid sequestrants or ezetimibe, may be used in combination to further manage cholesterol levels.

It is important to follow the prescribed treatment plan and take all medications as directed by your healthcare provider to increase the chances of recovery. Getting better with active tuberculosis will depend on several factors, including the severity of the infection, your overall health, and how well you adhere to treatment. With proper treatment, most people can recover from active tuberculosis, but it may take several weeks to months to completely clear the infection from your body. It is crucial to maintain and complete the full course of treatment, even if you start feeling better before finishing it, to avoid further complications and prevent the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

The affected part of the brain is without oxygen for just a few minutes and soon recovers . This is because the blood clot either breaks up quickly or nearby blood vessels are able to compensate .

It manifests as a sudden onset of loose or watery stools (diarrhea), often accompanied by other symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever. The cause is often due to ingesting contaminated food or water, but it can also be spread through contact with infected individuals or by eating food that has been improperly handled or prepared. It can affect anyone, even those who are normally healthy and have strong immune systems. Prevention is key, and this includes practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands thoroughly, avoiding food that may be contaminated, and staying hydrated.

If the cancer spreads beyond the tumor site to other parts of the body, survival rates decline. Even with treatment, some children may experience recurrence of the disease. Prognostic factors include: - Age at diagnosis: Children diagnosed before age 1 tend to have a worse prognosis than older children. - Stage of the disease: Advanced-stage neuroblastoma (Stage 3 and 4) is associated with a poorer prognosis. - Tumor severity: Tumors with more aggressive features, such as those with a high mitotic rate or high levels of N-myc amplification",

When looking for signs of DMD , it is important to watch the child running and getting up from the floor - the muscle weakness is more noticeable during these activities . Tests are needed before DMD can be diagnosed . The first step in making the diagnosis is a blood test . This tests for creatine kinase . Children with DMD always have a very high level of creatine kinase ( about 10 - 100 times normal ) . Therefore , if a child 's creatine kinase level is normal then DMD is ruled out . If the creatine kinase level is high , further tests are needed to see whether this is due to DMD or to some other condition . The next step in diagnosing DMD involves either a muscle biopsy and/or genetic tests : A muscle biopsy involves taking a small sample of a muscle , under local anaesthetic . The sample is examined under a microscope using special techniques to look at the muscle fibres and the dystrophin protein . Genetic tests are done using a blood sample . The DNA in the blood is tested to look at the dystrophin gene . This test can diagnose most cases of DMD .,"

Benign paroxysomal positional vertigo is a common cause of vertigo characterized by recurring episodes of intense vertigo triggered by certain head movements without any other evidence of central or peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Vertigo is the sensation of spinning or dizziness that is often accompanied by nausea and imbalance.

Is it a relatively rare occurrence, or does it happen more frequently than we think?\nCauda equina syndrome is a condition characterized by compression or damage to the bundle of nerves at the base of the spine, known as the cauda equine. This compression can result in a range of symptoms, including low back pain, weakness, numbness, and loss of bowel and bladder control.\nWhile CES is considered a relatively rare condition, its exact prevalence is not well documented. Some studies suggest that it occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 to 30,000 surgical cases, typically following lumbar surgery or spinal trauma. However, others estimate the incidence to be as high as 1 in every 1000 to 2000 hospital admissions.\nOne of the challenges in determining the true incidence of CES is the variation in diagnostic criteria used by different studies.

The scope also contains a very fine needle . This needle is used to take samples of body tissue by pushing through the bronchus to the tissue on the other side . The needle holds the sample of tissue ; this is called aspiration . Transbronchial means across the bronchus , giving the name transbronchial needle aspiration .,"

A) Platelet aggregate in cerebral aery B) Emboli from atrial septal defect C) Thrombosis in MCA D) Septic emboli from dental infection\nThe answer is A) Platelets aggregate in cerebral artery. A transient ischaemia attack is caused by a temporary blockage of the blood supply to the brain, usually due to a blood clot or plaque buildup in a cerebral vessel. The blockage typically clears on its own, restoring blood flow to the brain tissue.\nThe symptoms of a transient ischemic attack can be similar to those of a stroke, including sudden onset of weakness or numbness in the face, arm or leg, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, and loss of balance or coordination.

Insulin is indeed one of the most effective ways for many people with diabetes to manage their blood sugar levels. But it\u2019s important to understand the basics of insulin therapy before we dive into the answers to your other questions. 1. How does insulin work? Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, and it helps regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in your bloodstream. When you eat, your blood sugar level rises, and your pancreas releases insulin to help move this glucose into your cells for energy or storage. In diabetes, the body either doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or doesn\u2019t use it effectively (Type 2 diabetes). So, by giving yourself insulin injections or using an insulin pump, you\u2019re replacing the insulin your body can\u2019t produce or using it more effectively. 2.
