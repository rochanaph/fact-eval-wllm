This fact can potentially be used in the treatment of spasticity, where a decrease in muscle contractions is desired . Theoretically, this decrease in muscle activity could be caused by peripheral nerve blockade or blockade of motor endplates . The former seems to be more likely, because low-frequency stimulation ( LFS ) evokes hypercontraction after stopping the current. This is in contrast to muscle relaxation after peripheral nerve injury . This phenomenon does not arise in the same manner with high-frequency stimulations .

When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain .

Therefore, this study was designed to determine the levels of selected heavy metals in the patient's medications which contain different heavy metals. The risk to the patient' medication due to exposure to heavy metals and the possible side effects of these heavy metals were investigated. This is the only study with this objective that is done in Saudi Arabia, so far. Furthermore, this study also aimed to determine the quality of some medication brands containing potassium chloride based on the levels of heavy metals used in the preparation of the drug. Potassium chloraide is used to treat hypertensive crisis and is found in many different brands and types. Therefore, the levels of potassium in these brands were also investigated.",

This delay is not related to the half-life of gonadotropins in the body, but rather to the time needed for the follicles to mature into ovulatory size. This difference in recuperation time depends on the number of follicles in the ovaries, called the ovarian reserve, which plays a critical role in the recuperative capacity of the ovarium . When the ovariar reserve is exhausted, the reproductive ability of the female will permanently be lowered, a decline that was termed by Woodruff et al.  \"reproductive aging\".

Occasionally , the disease process reverses . This is uncommon , apart from the following : Children . Sometimes hypothyroidism is a temporary condition in older children . ( This is not so for children who are born with an underactive thyroid . ) Pregnancy . Some women develop thyroid imbalance after having a baby . If it occurs , it typically happens about three to six months after the birth . Often this lasts just a few months and corrects itself . Treatment is needed only in a small number of cases . However , afterwards it is wise to have a yearly blood test , as there is an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroiditis and long - term hypothyroidism in the future .,"

Examples include : Relaxed , slow , deep breathing : breathe in gently through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. These exercises help to relax the airway dilators and reduce breathlessness. Relaxed breathing helps you to take appropriate amounts of time to breathe in and out through your nose, and to pause so as not to interrupt chest breathing.Slow breathing : inhale gently through your mouth and exhale through your nose. Count how often your breath enters and leaves your nostrils. Try to make it around 5 to 8. Relax your shoulders, and repeat your breath count for a total of 5 minutes.Stop or diaphragmatic breathing: inhale deeply through your nose to the count of 4, hold your breath to the count 7, and then exhale through pursed pink lips to the count on 8. Repeat it five times. Breathing through your diaphragram provides you with more oxygen and reduces breathlessness.Diaphragm exercises: try drawing your stomach in as you take a deep",

Examples include : Relaxed , slow , deep breathing : breathe in gently through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. When breathing in through your nose, the air is first moistened and warmed in the nose before it is warmed and humidified on its way to the lungs. If possible, breathing in through the nose helps to make breathing easier.A diaphragmatic breathing : breathe deeply through your nose. Breathe in completely; this way your stomach should move and your chest should become bigger. Exhale completely, through your open mouth, while making a sound like \u201ceeee\u201d or \u201cwhooooo\u201d. This can help your lungs to empty all air. Breathing using the chest and back only is not very efficient.Paced breathing. You inhale and exhale during a count of four.

Try to breathe in rhythm with your steps at a speed you find comfortable . Controlled breathing . This involves using your diaphragm and lower chest muscles to breathe instead of your upper chest and shoulder muscles . Breathe gently and keep your shoulders and upper chest muscles relaxed . Use different comfortable seating and standing positions when you feel breathless . Different positions suit different people but examples include : When standing up , lean from the hips with your forearms resting on something at a comfortable height , such as a chair or kitchen work surface . When standing or walking , put your hands on your hips or in your pockets . When sitting , lean forwards , resting your forearms on your knees , on the arms of a chair , or on a table . Arrange the things you use every day to make sure they are easy to reach . Try to stay active but take a rest when you feel breathless and then start again .,"

As a result, the duration of the T wave on the ECG is slightly longer, for example in the case of the T lead in lead V2. However, in most patients the time delay of the atriocardiac node is not very different from the distance from the atribular bundle to the lower right ventricle ( = 60ms), so that in terms of the electrical propagation between the atrium and ventricle, there is no time difference that can be noticeable in the ECG. The problem becomes more interesting in patients with bradycardia (due to a prolonged or extended PR interval) . Here, the delayed electrical conduction at the atriaventricular node can be long enough that there is a clinically clearly perceptible ventricular pulse in the EKG. This is the cause of a junctional rhythm. There is usually still a T wave that is much broader than normal and corresponds in",
        "unwatermarked_text": "impulse gets to the atrioventricular node ( AV node ) at the lower right atrium . This acts like a ' junction box ' and the impulse is delayed slightly. If there is no AV block the impulse then gets through the AV node, via the His\u2010Purkinje system into the ventricular tissues, causing the heart to contract. However due to the AV block there is a delay in this phase ( see Fig. 8 ). The main problem caused by even this mild type of AV block is that the ventricles do not contract enough in order to pump the blood hard enough up through the pulmonary artery to the lungs ( where there is increased pulmonary pressure ). This results in elevated pressure in the right ventricle leading to the development of what is diagnosed as pulmonary hypertension. This is a progressive pathological process, resulting frequently in what is termed as end\u2010stage right ventricular failure. This can lead to the closing of the tricuspid (right atrioventicular) valve to form a ' dead heart ' and this can lead to either death or",
        "natural_text": ". Most of the tissue between the atria and ventricles does not conduct the impulse . However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
