During AF electrical impulses originating in the sinus node and ventriclc nodal tissue are blocked before they can enter the atria. The loss of sinoatrial impulse generation, together with the loss of dominant atrial or ventricular pacemaker activity, results in atrial fbrillation. A number of distinces of this arrhythmia from normal sinus rhythm have been clearly demonstrated by the recent work of Mahaim and of Potma, Hanna and Cohen. 1 The latter workers showed that the duration of the P-P or P-R interval, usually shortened in normal sinus beats, is no different from the atrioventricular",

In spite of its high prevalence, little attention is devoted to AF as a possible cause of symptoms or complications such as embolic events. 2 Atrial fibrilla tion is seen most commonly in the elderly in association with various predisposing cardiac conditions (eg, hypertension and heart failure).

The thin cortex of the scaphand bone causes the fracture to heal in a more or less complete position, by the production of a local osteitis at the fractured site. This, in contrast to the ankledislocation, is a simple fracture, and is therefore not subject to the same complications which attend fractures which involve the joint and thus damage the cartilage at this junction.\nA transverse fracture is often overlooked in the X-ray film unless the fracturing of the bone is well taken.

When looking for signs of DMD , it is important to watch the child running and getting up from the floor - the muscle weakness is more noticeable during these activities . Tests are needed before DMD can be diagnosed . The first step in making the diagnosis is a blood test . This tests for creatine kinase . Children with DMD always have a very high level of creatine kinase ( about 10 - 100 times normal ) . Therefore , if a child 's creatine kinase level is normal then DMD is ruled out . If the creatine kinase level is high , further tests are needed to see whether this is due to DMD or to some other condition . The next step in diagnosing DMD involves either a muscle biopsy and/or genetic tests : A muscle biopsy involves taking a small sample of a muscle , under local anaesthetic . The sample is examined under a microscope using special techniques to look at the muscle fibres and the dystrophin protein . Genetic tests are done using a blood sample . The DNA in the blood is tested to look at the dystrophin gene . This test can diagnose most cases of DMD .,"

Occasionally , coarctation of the aorta does not cause any symptoms or is not detected until adult life . Symptoms result from heart failure because the heart is not able to push blood through the narrowed part of the aorta .
