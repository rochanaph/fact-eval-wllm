        "watermarked_text": "machines are thought to work in two ways : On a high pulse rate of 90 - 130 Hz ( the normal method of use ), the electrical impulses from the muscle stimulator are delivered to the muscles in a series of rapid,high voltage pulses, which cause the muscles to contract strongly. This type of pulsation is useful for building strength and muscle mass. On a low pulse rate of about 3 Hz ( not recommended for anyone other than athletes), the impulses are delivered continuously to the muscles. This creates an effect similar to that of isometric muscle contraction,and is useful for endurance and stamina. As an example, the squat machine typically uses a high pulse frequency for building strength, while Nordic treadmills tend to use a low pulse frequency for stamina building. It is also considered that the pulsation in some machines, perhaps unnecessarily, can be increased to values as high as 200 - 300 Hz to try to get even more strength from the muscles. Some machines also allow users to adjust the duration of the contraction phase and the rest phase between contractions, which can be a useful feature for targeting specific types of muscle fibres",

The machine is adjusted so that the intensity of the electrical pulses is comfortable but not painful. The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated, but typically 15 - 30 minutes is sufficient. Treatments can be carried out daily for as long as needed.\nWhile TENS is generally safe and well - tolerated when used as directed, there are some contraindications. These include :\n1.

This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain . When the machine is set on a low pulse rate ( 2 - 5 Hz ) it stimulates the body to make its own pain - easing chemicals called endorphins . These act a bit like morphine to block pain signals .,"

You know, I often tell him : \" Challenges are not something to be afraid of, but something to be overcome. \" For me, it's very important to teach my child this lesson, so he can grow up to be a strong, independent person.

The truth is that unless the question is asked in exactly the same way, different surveys will give different answers. Different surveys may also produce different results for the same question, asked in the same way. So it is difficult to compare the findings of different polls, as they do not measure the same thing. The only reliable way to assess electoral support is at the ballot box.\nIt is also essential to consider the sample from which the data is collected. If a survey includes too few people from certain parts of the country or particular demographic groups, the results may not be representative of the whole population. Some polls use quota sampling to make sure the sample reflects certain key characteristics of the population. Others rely on random sampling and hope that these characteristics are naturally represented in the sample. The choice between the two approaches can affect the results.\nAnother important consideration is the methodology used to collect the data.

HD is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the brain and causes loss of control over movements, behavior, and thinking abilities. Symptoms usually start between ages 30 and 50 but can appear at any age. Early signs and symptoms may include involuntary jerking or writhing movements, difficulty with coordination and balance, uncontrolled gestures, mood swings, irritability, apath\n, and forgetfulness. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience difficulties with speech and swallowing, cognition and behavior, and physical functioning, including walking and other motor skills.  What treatments are available for Huntington's disease and how do they work? Although there is no cure for Huntington's diseas e, several medications and therapies can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

Rheumatic heart disease is a general term which means any heart problem which develops after having rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever most commonly affects the mitral valve and the aortic valve. Common symptoms may include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, palpitations or feeling faint. If left untreated, rheumatic fever can lead to complications such as infective endocarditis, heart valve blockage, or even heart failure. Medical history, physical examination, and echocardiogram are commonly used to diagnose the condition. The treatment for most cases involves taking antibiotics, especially during episodes of rheumatic fever, and in some cases, surgical repair or replacement of the affected valves may be necessary. Maintaining good dental hygiene and regular visits to healthcare professionals can help prevent the spread of streptococcal infections and subsequent development of rheumatic heart disease.

Rheumatic heart disease is a general term which means any heart problem which develops after having rheumatic fever. Most, but not all, people who experience rheumatic fever develop some form of heart disease. Rheumatic fever commonly affects the hearts valves, particularly the mitral valve and the aortic valve. Over time, the valve becomes thick and stiff, causing it to be less able to open and close properly. As a result, blood can leak backward, leading to problems like heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and blood clots. The long-term effects of rheumatic fever on the heart can be serious, potentially leading to heart failure or other complications. Early recognition and treatment of rheumatic heart disease are crucial to prevent further damage to the heart and its valves. Management of the condition includes medication to reduce inflammation and antibiotics to prevent recurrent infection. In some cases, surgical intervention, such as valve repair or replacement, may be necessary to restore proper heart function.

In autoimmune diseases the body's immune system becomes overactive, and instead of attacking the germs, it starts attacking the healthy cells and tissues of the body, causing damage and diseases.\nAutoimmune diseases include conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. The exact cause of these diseases is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain genetic markers have been identified in individuals with autoimmune diseases, indicating that there may be a genetic predisposition to these conditions. Environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals or infections may also trigger the development of autoimmune diseases in individuals who are genetically susceptible. Treatment for autoimmune diseases typically involves managing symptoms and suppressing the immune system to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the body's tissues. In some cases, medications that modulate the immune response are used to treat these conditions. However, the treatment for each autoimmune disease can vary depending on the specific symptoms and affected organs. Scientists are still studying the causes and mechanisms behind autoimmune",

In autoimmune diseases the immune system mistakenly identifies some of the body's own cells or tissues as foreign or harmful, and produces antibodies to attack them.\nIn the case of an allergy, the immune system reacts to normally harmless substances like pollen or certain foods, seeing them as foreign invaders and producing antibodies against them. These antibodies then trigger the release of chemicals that cause symptoms such as sneezing, itching, or rashes.\nWhen the immune system is properly functioning, it helps us stay healthy by fighting off infections and foreign substances. However, when it malfunctions, as in autoimmune diseases or allergies, it can cause us harm and lead to symptoms or chronic conditions. Understanding how the immune system works can help us better manage our health and seek appropriate treatment when needed.

Examples include : Relaxed, slow, deep breathing : breathe in gently through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. Pursed lip breathing : hold your breath for a few seconds after breathing in, then breathe out slowly through pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. Diaphragmatic breathing : lie on your back with one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose, feeling the hand on your abdomen move outwards as you breathe in. Then breathe out slowly though your mouth while feeling your abdomen move inwards. Singing or humming : This can help to keep your airways open. Remember to take regular breaks when doing any of these breathing exercises, and if you find them hard to do at first, practice them at home with the help of a respiratory therapist. It may also be helpful to learn relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscular relaxation or guided imagery, to help manage stress and anxiety that can contribute to breathlessness.

Inspiratory hold technique or \u201cholding your breath\u201d : take a slow breath in and then hold your breath for a few seconds before exhaling. This technique can help to fill your lungs with more air and may reduce the feeling of breathlessness. These techniques can be used together with certain medications to help manage your breathlessness. You should discuss these techniques with your healthcare provider to determine which one works best for you. Managing breathlessness during physical activity is also important, and your healthcare provider or respiratory therapist can provide guidance on how to pace yourself and plan your activities accordingly. Breathing exercises can be particularly useful during episodes of breathlessness, before and after exercise, and when lying flat. It is important to remember that while these breathing techniques can help relieve breathlessness, they may not eliminate it completely.",

Different positions suit different people but examples include : When standing up , lean from the hips with your forearms resting on something at a comfortable height , such as a chair or kitchen work surface . When standing or walking , put your hands on your hips or in your pockets . When sitting , lean forwards , resting your forearms on your knees , on the arms of a chair , or on a table .

        "watermarked_text": "impulse gets to the atrioventricular node ( AV node ) at the lower right atrium. This acts like a'junction box'and the impulse is delayed slightly (approximately 0.1 seconds) before passing down the bundle of His and its branches to the ventricles. The impulse is then rapidly distributed throughout the ventricular myocardium via the network of Purkinje fibers, resulting in the depolarization of the ventricLES. It is only when the impulse reaches the ventricLes that the atria cease to contract, because the impulse does not retraverse the atrio-ventricular node. Thus, the atria have effectively finished contracting before the ventric LES.\nIn summary, the sequence of contraction of the cardiac chambers is as follows: 1. Atrial depolarization (P wave on ECG), 2. Atrial contraction (t wave on EGC), 3. Delay in AV node, 4. Ventricular depolarization, and 5. Ventricular contraction. The ventricles contract only after the atria complete their contraction.\n## Heart Rate Variability\nHeart rate variability refers to the",

This acts like a'junction box'and the impulse is delayed slightly before being transmitted to the bundle of His, an electrical band that runs down the center of the interventricular septum (the wall between the upper chambers and the lower chambers of the heart).\n  4. Once the impulse reaches the bundle of Himan, it splits into the right and left bundle branches that carry the electrical signal to the ventricles. These branches stimulate the muscle of the ventriccles to contract.\n  5. The electrical signal travels through the ventricules from the base of the heart (close to the heart valves ) towards the apex (the tip of the heart). This is why the contraction starts at the bottom of the heart and moves up.\n  6. As the ventricular muscle contracts, it pushes blood out to the systemic circulation (to the rest of the body) and the pulmonary circulation (to and from the lungs).\n  7. After the contraction, the electrical signal is reset (repolarized) by the sinoatrial",
        "natural_text": ". Most of the tissue between the atria and ventricles does not conduct the impulse . However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
