These impulses stimulate the nerve fibers to release neurotransmitting substances that help to relieve the pain. This is thought to be the primary mechanism of action for TENS. On a low pulse rate of 2-10 Hz, TENS is thought to act by inhibiting pain transmission in the spinal cord. This is known as the gate control theory of pain. It involves the stimulation of large diameter myelinated fibers in the skin which compete for synaptic space in the spinal cord with the pain fibers, thus reducing the transmission of pain. This mechanism is useful for chronic pain and can be used to reduce the intensity of pain or stop it altogether. It is also used to improve circulation, reduce muscle spasm, and promote relaxation of muscles. TENS can be used for a variety of chronic pain conditions, including arthritis, low back pain, fibromyalgia, dental pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome",

Some have multiple channels which allow for the use of several pairs of electrodes simultaneously, whilst others have single channel devices.\nThe electrodes are usually made of a conductive rubber or gel-filled material and are placed on the skin in the area to be treated. The machine is adjusted so that the intensity of the electrical pulses is comfortable but not painful. The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated, but typically 15 - 30 minutes is sufficient. Treatments can be carried out daily for as long as needed.\nWhile TENS is generally safe and well - tolerated when used as directed, there are some contraindications. These include :\n1.

This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain .

The truth is that unless the question is asked in exactly the same way, different surveys will give different results. And if the question is asked in different ways, the only sure result is that the opinions expressed in the papers will not be exactly the same.\nThere are many ways in which a question of this kind can be put. The standard method, used by Gallup and others, is to ask which party the electors would like to see in power after the next election. There is a simpler form of the question, commonly asked in preferential elections, which asks people to choose between the names of individual leaders, without specifying parties. The latter method can give an indication of the personality factor in elections, which is always difficult to measure accurately.\nA question asked in relation to a hypothetical election also involves an element of uncertainty. People's preferences sometimes change in the course of a campaign, and what they say now may not be what they will think next spring.

See the end of this page for more information on the inheritance pattern of HD.\nHD is usually diagnosed in people in their 30s to 50s, although it can appear earlier or later in life. The symptoms of HD can vary from person to person, but common early symptoms include involuntary jerking movements, difficulties with coordination and balance, and cognitive changes such as problems with concentration, planning, and memory. As the disease progresses, motor and speech difficulties, plus psychiatric symptoms, become more apparent. People with HD may also experience mood swings, irritability, and depression. There is currently no cure for HD, but there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms.\nThe future prognosis for people with HD can vary depending on the rates of disease progression and the level of care they receive. With proper support and treatment, people with HD can maintain a good quality of life for many years.

They can briefly be divided into the tarsal bones , the long bones ( metatarsals ) and the phalanges . The tarsal bones are the larger bones that form the back section of the foot , with the calcaneum being the largest . There are five metatarsal bones and these are given names from the first to the fifth . The first metatarsal bone is the largest and is the bone that joins to the big toe . Each toe has three phalanges , except the big toe which only has two . There are many nerves , muscles and ligaments within the foot . Of note , the common plantar digital nerves run between the metatarsal bones in the foot . These have branches that supply sensation to the skin of the toes .,"

This may be due to the nerve being squashed between the heel bone and the surrounding tissues during walking or other activities. In most cases, the underlying cause is not known. However, it is often associated with other foot problems such as bunions, corns, or hammertoes. Neurotics and people with an irregular walking pattern are more prone to this condition. The condition is more common in women than men. The pain is usually described as a burning or shooting sensation in the heel or on the front of the foot, especially when standing or walking for a long time. It is often exacerbated by wearing tight-fitting or poorly designed shoes. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and imaging tests such as X-rays and MRI. Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause, protecting the foot from further damage, using anti-inflammatory medication,and in some cases, corticosteroid injections or plantar fasciotomy surgery.ysics_treatment\u300b{text prostitut_course | exact | c-drop-beanbag\u300b{text prosthetic_course | exact |",

For example , the space between the long bones ( metatarsals ) in the foot is narrower between the second and third and between the third and fourth metatarsals . This means that the nerves that run between these metatarsals are more likely to be compressed and irritated . Wearing narrow shoes can make this compression worse . Sometimes , other problems can contribute to the compression of the nerve . These include the growth of a fatty lump ( called a lipoma ) and also the formation of a fluid - filled sac that can form around a joint ( a bursa ) .

When the heart valves are damaged, they can become faulty and can't close properly. This can cause blood to back up into the heart or leak out, leading to various complications. One of the most serious problems is mitral stenosis, where the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle becomes narrowed, which can lead to swelling in the lungs and heart failure.

Rheumatic heart disease is a general term which means any heart problem which develops after having rheumatic fever. Most, but not all, people who experience rheumatic fever develop some form of heart disease. Rheumatic fever commonly affects the hearts valves, particularly the mitral valve and the aortic valve. Over time, the valve becomes thick and stiff, causing it to be less able to open and close properly. As a result, blood can leak backward, leading to problems like heart failure, irregular heartbeats, and blood clots. The long-term effects of rheumatic fever on the heart can be serious, potentially leading to heart failure or other complications. Early recognition and treatment of rheumatic heart disease are crucial to prevent further damage to the heart and its valves. Management of the condition includes medication to reduce inflammation and antibiotics to prevent recurrent infection. In some cases, surgical intervention, such as valve repair or replacement, may be necessary to restore proper heart function.

This can happen after an injury or when you overuse your elbow.\nElbow bursitis is another possible cause of elbow pain. Bursae are small, fluid-filled sacs found throughout the body, including around the elbow joint. They help reduce friction between bones and soft tissues. However, when the bursa near the elbow gets irritated or infected, it becomes swollen and tender, leading to pain and stiffness in the elbow. Activities like throwing, elbow bends, or wearing a tight accessory can cause bursitis.\nOsteoar",

In autoimmune diseases the immune system can't tell the difference between your own body cells and foreign invaders. It starts to attack your own healthy cells and tissues. This causes inflammation, often in specific parts of the body. There are different types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and lupus. The exact cause of these diseases is not known, but they may be linked to genetics, certain infections, or environmental factors. Treatment for autoimmune diseases usually involves medicines to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms.

In autoimmune diseases the immune system mistakenly identifies some of the body's own cells or tissues as foreign or harmful, and produces antibodies to attack them.\nIn the case of an allergy, the immune system reacts to normally harmless substances like pollen or certain foods, seeing them as foreign invaders and producing antibodies against them. These antibodies then trigger the release of chemicals that cause symptoms such as sneezing, itching, or rashes.\nWhen the immune system is properly functioning, it helps us stay healthy by fighting off infections and foreign substances. However, when it malfunctions, as in autoimmune diseases or allergies, it can cause us harm and lead to symptoms or chronic conditions.

Hormones can also affect our moods and feelings. So, hormones play a really important role in keeping our bodies working properly and helping us feel happy and healthy.://\nIs diabetes a hormone imbalance? Why or why not?\nNo, diabetes is not a hormone imbalance. Diabetes is a condition where the body has trouble regulating blood sugar levels. While hormones like insulin and glucagon are involved in regulating blood sugar, diabetes is not caused by an imbalance of hormones alone. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, which is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. In type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin. So, diabetes is more about a problem with insulin production or the body's response to it, rather than an overall hormone imbalance",

This leads to an inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart tissue, causing the heart to ache or feel uncomfortable in the chest. The reduced blood flow is often due to atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque within the coronary arteries, or other conditions that restrict blood flow to the heart.

To correct this, doctors might use a procedure called reduction, where the bone fragments are manually put back in their correct position before being immobilized with plaster or screws. Displacement can occur in any type of fracture, including hip fractures, arm fractures, and leg fractures. The choice of treatment depends on the severity and location of the fracture, but often includes immobilization to allow for proper healing.

They can also be used to monitor the growth and health of a fetus during pregnancy.\nUltrasound also uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body, but instead of radio waves, it uses high-frequency sound waves. The device that produces these sound waves is called a transducer. It's usually attached to a probe that you hold or lie on. The sound waves travel into your body and are reflected back by the organs and structures.

One or both of the following may be involved in the development of hypothyroidism: iodine insufficiency and autoimmune thyroid destruction. Autoimmune thyroid destruction commonly presents as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, leading to decreased production of thyroid hormones. Inadequate iodine intake or thyroid inflammation can disrupt thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, contributing to the development of hypothyroidism. In addition to these factors, certain medications, radiation exposure, and surgical removal of the thyroid gland can also cause hypothyroidism. Environmental triggers and certain genetic mutations can also play a role in the development of hypothyroidism. This condition is typically managed with synthetic thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Regular monitoring of hormone levels is necessary to ensure appropriate management and determine the correct dosage of thyroid medication.://<\\/a> g\\u00e8s=0\nWhat are the causes of hypothyroidism? \ud83e\udd14\nHypothyroidism can be caused by several factors.

One or both of the following may be required: 1) TSH ( Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ) blood test to measure the level of thyroid hormone secretion 2) Free T4 blood test to check the level of active thyroid hormone ( thyroxine ) in the blood. This will help determine the diagnosis and if further investigation is required. If hyperthyroidism is suspected, blood tests may include those for TSH, free T4, and thyroid autoantibodies. Depending on the results of these tests, other tests may be ordered to further evaluate thyroid function and to exclude other conditions. Possible treatment options for hyperthyroid related issues include: Beta blockers to help manage symptoms of rapid heart rate and tremors, and are often prescribed as an initial step in treatment Radioactive iodine therapy to destroy the overactive thyroid tissue Thyroidectomy ( removal of the thyroid gland ), sometimes needed for more severe cases Antithyroid medications like propylthiouracil ( PTU ) or methim",

If the level of thyroxine in the blood is low , then the pituitary releases more TSH to try to stimulate the thyroid gland to make more thyroxine . Therefore , a raised level of TSH means the thyroid gland is underactive and is not making enough thyroxine . Thyroxine . A low level of thyroxine confirms hypothyroidism . Other tests are not usually necessary unless a rare cause of hypothyroidism is suspected . For example , tests of the pituitary gland may be done if both the TSH and thyroxine levels are low . Some people have a raised TSH level but have a normal thyroxine level . This means that you are making enough thyroxine but the thyroid gland is needing extra stimulation from TSH to make the required amount of thyroxine . In this situation you have an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism in the future . Your doctor may advise a repeat blood test every so often to see if you do eventually develop hypothyroidism .,"

This acts like a'junction box'and the impulse is delayed slightly to allow time for the ventricles to'fill up' with blood. Then, it travels down the bundle of His and the left and right bundle branches to reach the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood out to the rest of the body.  In summary, the cardiac cycle begins with an electrical impulse generated at the sinoatrial node, which causes the atria to contract. The impulse then travels to the atrioventricular node, where it is delayed briefly, before continuing down to the ventricles, which contract to pump blood out of the heart.  The answer is Sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and bundle of His.  15) The contractile component of the cardiac cycle involves the contraction of the ventricles to pump blood out of the heart.  The contraction of the ventricles is pharmacologically controlled by norepinephrine.  Norepinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors",

These branches stimulate the muscle of the ventriccles to contract.\n  5. The electrical signal travels through the ventricules from the base of the heart (close to the heart valves ) towards the apex (the tip of the heart). This is why the contraction starts at the bottom of the heart and moves up.\n  6.

This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) .
