This fact can potentially be used in the treatment of spasticity, where a decrease in muscle contractions is desired . Theoretically, this decrease in muscle activity could be caused by peripheral nerve blockade or blockade of motor endplates . The former seems to be more likely, because low-frequency stimulation ( LFS ) evokes hypercontraction after stopping the current. This is in contrast to muscle relaxation after peripheral nerve injury . This phenomenon does not arise in the same manner with high-frequency stimulations .

This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain . When the machine is set on a low pulse rate ( 2 - 5 Hz ) it stimulates the body to make its own pain - easing chemicals called endorphins . These act a bit like morphine to block pain signals .,"

Epidemic control efforts had little success and, as death counts continued to mount, rumors that foreign responders were stealing body parts of the dead for profit proliferated . The government, in the first months of the epidemic, did little to combat this perception.

Common faints can be related to the normal contractile activity of the heart such that, transient impairments in cerebral blood flow result from reductions in cardiac output . The central events underlying common faints may be mediated by reflex mechanisms involving brain-stem neurons, which detect changes in cardiac activity. These neurons can influence the activity of many other regions in the brain, including those regulating the heart. Reduced or changed cardiac activity gives rise to a sudden decrease in blood pressure; this results in cerebral blood flow changes, sufficient to induce a syncope .

Occasionally , the disease process reverses . This is uncommon , apart from the following : Children . Sometimes hypothyroidism is a temporary condition in older children . ( This is not so for children who are born with an underactive thyroid . ) Pregnancy . Some women develop thyroid imbalance after having a baby . If it occurs , it typically happens about three to six months after the birth . Often this lasts just a few months and corrects itself . Treatment is needed only in a small number of cases . However , afterwards it is wise to have a yearly blood test , as there is an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroiditis and long - term hypothyroidism in the future .,"

Examples include : Relaxed , slow , deep breathing : breathe in gently through your nose and breathe out through your mouth; pursed-lip breathing : seal your lips and breathe slowly out through your lips; diaphragmatic breathing : keep your chest and shoulders still while breathing deeply through your stomach (use your hands to help); lamb breathing . This breathing technique can help to reduce breathlessness . It involves breathing in through your nose like a lamb, keeping your breath in briefly, and then breathing out slowly through your mouth. Practice relaxed breathing and calm routines.Try not to stress about things or overdo activities that could make your breathlessness worse; that will only make things worse.Try to be as active as you can. Be guided by your body, and try not to think about your breathlessness\u2014focus your attention on something else. Be reassured\u2014your breathlessness will improve when you rest.

        "unwatermarked_text": "breathing control techniques that can help to reduce breathlessness . Examples include : Relaxed , slow , deep breathing : breathe in gently through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. When breathing in through your nose, the air is first moistened and warmed in the nose before it is warmed and humidified on its way to the lungs. If possible, breathing in through the nose helps to make breathing easier.A diaphragmatic breathing : breathe deeply through your nose. Breathe in completely; this way your stomach should move and your chest should become bigger. Exhale completely, through your open mouth, while making a sound like \u201ceeee\u201d or \u201cwhooooo\u201d. This can help your lungs to empty all air. Breathing using the chest and back only is not very efficient.Paced breathing. You inhale and exhale during a count of four. If the count is not possible, breathe in while counting to four in your mind, then exhale and count to eight or any suitable number.Pursed-lip breathing is like breathing through a straw, it helps to keep the air",

Try to breathe in rhythm with your steps at a speed you find comfortable . Controlled breathing . This involves using your diaphragm and lower chest muscles to breathe instead of your upper chest and shoulder muscles . Breathe gently and keep your shoulders and upper chest muscles relaxed . Use different comfortable seating and standing positions when you feel breathless . Different positions suit different people but examples include : When standing up , lean from the hips with your forearms resting on something at a comfortable height , such as a chair or kitchen work surface . When standing or walking , put your hands on your hips or in your pockets . When sitting , lean forwards , resting your forearms on your knees , on the arms of a chair , or on a table . Arrange the things you use every day to make sure they are easy to reach . Try to stay active but take a rest when you feel breathless and then start again .,"

        "watermarked_text": "impulse gets to the atrioventricular node ( AV node ) at the lower right atrium . This acts like a ' junction box ' and the impulse is delayed slightly there. It then sends the impulse along the specialized myocytes of the His-Purkinje system into the ventricular septum and the walls of the ventricles . The His-Purkinje system is made up of smaller specialized cells than the regular myocytes in the ventricles. The equal-sized cells in this system are called Purkinje fibers. They form a system of bundles. This is why, in dogs with HCM, endocardial F heart patterns are often observed . At the cellular level, HCM is characterised by cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and fiber disarray. There is also a variable degree of myocardial fibrosis that is the consequence of an inflammatory component. Details about the specific genetic/non-genetic risk factors, basic mechanisms, and anatomic and cellular features of HCM are provided in Appendix 2. These include",

If there is no AV block the impulse then gets through the AV node, via the His\u2010Purkinje system into the ventricular tissues, causing the heart to contract. However due to the AV block there is a delay in this phase ( see Fig. 8 ). The main problem caused by even this mild type of AV block is that the ventricles do not contract enough in order to pump the blood hard enough up through the pulmonary artery to the lungs ( where there is increased pulmonary pressure ). This results in elevated pressure in the right ventricle leading to the development of what is diagnosed as pulmonary hypertension. This is a progressive pathological process, resulting frequently in what is termed as end\u2010stage right ventricular failure. This can lead to the closing of the tricuspid (right atrioventicular) valve to form a ' dead heart ' and this can lead to either death or",
        "natural_text": ". Most of the tissue between the atria and ventricles does not conduct the impulse . However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
