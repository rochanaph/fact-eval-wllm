The device consists of a receiver-stimulator housed in a small titanium case that is attached to a coil that protrudes through the skin. The coil picks up the signals transmitted by a transmitter coil connected to an audio processor worn externally. The audio processor has an antenna system for receiving the signals from the transmitter coil, a computer chip that processes these signals, and an output transducer that converts the processed signals into electrical pulses sent to the cochlear electrode.

The elasticity of the overlying skin allows it to shrink down on the smaller frame.\"\nI've explained this to numerous people and as it turns out it's a VERY common question so I thought I'd put it out there for you all as well.\nAs we age, certain body changes can occur, including loss of subcutaneous fat beneath the skin and a decrease in the production of collagen and elastin. These changes can result in sagging or drooping skin, particularly in areas prone to gravity, such as the face, neck, and hands. Sagging skin can make us appear older or less youthful.\nIn the case of the tip of the nose, there are several reasons why it might sag with age. Firstly, the tip ofthe nose is made up of cartilage and bone, and over time, these structures can weaken and lose their shape. Secondly, the skin around the tip ofnose is thinner and has less underlying supportive tissue compared to other areas of the face, making it more susceptible to sagging. Lastly, the nasal tip can be affected by",

Additionally, a facelIFT will not stop the aging process, so maintenance touch-ups may be necessary over time.\nFor those who are considering a facelifT, it is essential to have an in-depth consultation with a qualified surgeon who can assess your specific needs and desires, and discuss the potential benefits and risks associated with the procedure.

Other factors that may contribute to the development of BDD include : - Body dissatisfaction : Many people with BDD have a strong desire for their bodies to look differently. - Trauma : Some individuals with BDD may have experienced some form of childhood trauma or abuse. - Family history : BDD can sometimes run in families, suggesting a genetic component. - Psychological factors : BDD often involves negative self - evaluation and intrusive thinking about one's physical appearance. - Environmental factors : Societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards may also contribute to the condition. In summary, while the exact cause of BDD remains unknown, it is believed to be a combination of biological, genetic, and psychological factors.",

This is similar to the way a compulsion may temporarily ease the anxiety or distress of an obsessional thought in someone with OCD . Also , the treatment of OCD and BDD is much the same ( see below ) . Despite their similarities , BDD and OCD are thought to be two different conditions . People with BDD tend to have a greater tendency to suicide , substance misuse and depression . See the separate leaflet called Obsessive - compulsive Disorder for more information . Slight changes in the balance of some brain chemicals ( neurotransmitters ) such as serotonin may play a role in causing OCD and BDD . This is why medication is thought to help ( see below ) .

In the case of angina, the lack of blood flow is in the heart muscle, preventing it from getting enough oxygen and nutrients. This usually occurs when the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart are narrowed, often due to a buildup of fatty deposits called plaques.\nThe heart muscle doesn't have its own blood supply, so it relies on these coronary arteries to get oxygen-rich blood. When the flow of blood is restricted, the heart muscle can't get the oxygen it needs, which can lead to chest pain, also known as angina.

Episodes recur at frequent intervals, often as unpredictable events. Rare fatal complications can occur, such as lung abscess, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment, including hospitalization, intravenous fluids, and pain control, improves symptoms and outcomes. Prevention of further episodes focuses on dietary changes and avoidance of triggers known to cause gastroesophageal reflux and subsequent vomiting. Long-term medical management may involve antireflux medication or surgical interventions to reduce gastric acidity and prevent future episodes.

Falling on to your elbow or shoulder is likely to put more strain on the joint and increase the risk of dislocation.\nOther factors that can contribute to a shoulder dislocation include:\nHaving a previous shoulder injury or surgery\nPlaying certain sports, such as rugby, American football or ice hockey\nHaving certain pre-existing conditions, such as hyperlaxity (excess flexibility) in your joints, genetic factors, or conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nCertain activities or poses during exercise, such as overhead throwing or repetitive shoulder movements\nIn some cases, a shoulder disintegration can occur spontaneously without any obvious cause. This can be related to underlying conditions that make the shoulder more prone to dislocation.\nThe type of shoulder dislocation depends on which ligaments and tendons are affected. The most common types include: anterior dislocation (also known as a shoulder separation), posterior dislocation, and superior dislocation.\nAnterior dislocation: \u00a0This is the most common type, accounting for about 95% of all shoulder dislocations",

You can also break your upper arm by falling on to your hand when your arm is straight , especially if it is out to your side . If you are elderly , it is possible you have developed ' thinning ' of the bones ( osteoporosis ) . This makes it more likely that you will break your arm following a relatively minor fall or accident . Occasionally you can break your upper arm because you have developed a type of cancer that is affecting the bone and has made it so weak that it has cracked . This is called a pathological fracture . In very small children their upper arm , particularly the shaft , can be broken by someone abusing them , by hitting or throwing them . Young people who break the top of their upper arm ( proximal fracture ) are more likely than older people to have also dislocated their shoulder . This is because the amount of force needed to break a young person 's arm is large and therefore it is more likely to have done other damage too .,"

If the bones haven't moved too far apart, some doctors will recommend using a small metal plate and screws to hold the fragments of the bone together. This is called \"internal fixation.\" The surgeon will make another small incision to place the plate and screws, and then the wound will be closed with stitches. Over time, the bone will heal and grow back together. This is why it's called a closed fracture. If a broken bone has come through the skin, the wound is open, and special treatment is needed to clean the wound and prevent infection. These fractures usually take longer to heal. It's important to follow your doctor's instructions and take care of your broken bone so that it can heal properly.\nA fracture is when a bone breaks. There are different types of fractures, like: 1.

The fluid buildup reduces the movement of the eardrum and hampers the transmission of sound to the inner ear, leading to a decrease in hearing ability. The hearing loss can range from mild to profound, depending on the amount of fluid present. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy to clear the infection, placement of tympanostomy tubes to drain the fluid, or watchful waiting if the condition is mild and does not cause significant hearing loss. Once the fluid is drained or the infection resolves, hearing typically returns to normal.\nWhat are the different types of fluid in the car system and where are they",

It clears up in time, but the damage is done. In this context,'sensorineural hearing loss'is a misnomer, as it implies the hair cells in the inner ear are not functioning properly. If the fluid in the inner-ear can be cleared promptly, the sensorineural component could be reversible, meaning the hair cells could regain their normal function. However, if the fluid remains for too long, it may cause permanent damage to the delicate structures of the inner ear. In summary, the term'sensorineural hearing\nloss'is not accurate in this situation because it implies hair cell dysfunction, which is not the case in a sudden attack of glue ear. The correct term would be'secretory otitis media'or'serous otitis media,' indicating that the cause is the secreted glue-like fluid rather than hair cell dysfunction.

After you eat, the gallbladder squeezes bile back into the common bile duct and down into the upper part of the small intestine (duodenum) to help break down fats from the food you have eaten.

The bile then flows through the ampulla into the main pancreatic duct and eventually reaches the duodeneum to help digest fats properly. The role of the gallbladders is to store and release bile from the liver into the small intestine when necessary. Without a gallbladder, the liver would have to send bile directly through the duct system to the small intestine which could lead to a reduction in the amount of bile available for digestion. However, most individuals without gallbladders are able to manage their digestion without issues.

Do not take a double dose to make up for the forgotten one.\nCan I stop taking levothyroid in the evening if I remember\nIt's not a good idea to stop taking levoxyl in the evening just because you remember. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements suggest that the full effect of levothyroxin takes several hours to develop. You want to take it at the same time each day, ideally in the morning, so your body has a steady supply of the medication throughout the day. Taking it at the prescribed time will help maintain a consistent level of the synthetic thyroid hormone in your bloodstream.\nCan I still eat dairy if I am taking levo thyroid\nYes, you can still eat dairy products while taking levo thyroxine. There are no known interactions between levo thyroxin and dairy products. However, keep in",

Occasionally , the disease process reverses . This is uncommon , apart from the following : Children . Sometimes hypothyroidism is a temporary condition in older children . ( This is not so for children who are born with an underactive thyroid . ) Pregnancy . Some women develop thyroid imbalance after having a baby . If it occurs , it typically happens about three to six months after the birth . Often this lasts just a few months and corrects itself . Treatment is needed only in a small number of cases . However , afterwards it is wise to have a yearly blood test , as there is an increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroiditis and long - term hypothyroidism in the future .,"

Examples include : Relaxed, slow, deep breathing : breathe in gently through your nose and breathe out through your mouth, taking about twice as long to breathe out as you do to breathe in. Controlled coughing : sit up and lean forward with your arms resting on your knees. Take a deep breath in, then cough forcefully. Repeat this several times. Pursed lip breathing : breathe out through pursed lips as if you were blowing out a candle. This can help increase the pressure in your lungs and make it easier to breathe.

This acts like a'junction box'and the impulse is delayed slightly here ( about 0.1 second ). From the AV node the impulse travels down the bundle of His and division of this bundle into right and left bundle branches at the level of the second and third ring of the atrio-ventricular ring. This occurs at the base of the interventricular septum and is known as the conduction axis. The right bundle branch runs down the inferior right ventricle and supplies the middle right ventrile fibers. The left bundle branch runs close to the left anterior descending coronary artery and supplies the anterior and middle fibers of the left ventricle. The left posterior descending coronary artery supplies the posterior third of the ventricles. A network of secondary branches spreads out in the ventricular masses, which consist of interwoven fascicles of Purkinje fibers.

Then it gets to the bundle of His, which is like a main electrical cable that sends the impulse downward through the ventricles dividing into two branches called the right and left bundle branches. These then transmit the impulse to stimulate the contraction of the ventricular muscles. Conduction of electrical impulses through the heart is a rapid process that normally takes less than 0.2 seconds. The electrical activity of the heart is measured by an electrocardiogram ( ECG ), which records the electrical potential changes on the body surface. This record is called an electrocardio gram. The P wave indicates atrial depolarization. The PR interval indicates the time it takes for the impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricLES. The QRS interval indicates ventricular depolarization, and the T wave indicates ventricular repolarization ( Figure 3 ).

        "natural_text": ". Most of the tissue between the atria and ventricles does not conduct the impulse . However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
