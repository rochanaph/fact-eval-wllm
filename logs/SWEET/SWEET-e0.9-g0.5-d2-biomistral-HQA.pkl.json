The short high current pulse with its rapid onset is thought to trigger voltage-sensitive sodium channels. These channels, according to current research are thought to maintain pain at the site (for example the dentine) of the primary nociceptive input because, in animal models it appears to maintain nociception. By counteracting this primary nocicpetive input during the acute application of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, pain reduction is produced. In this mechanism the nerve stimulation current is relatively high at 50 mA and it is not known whether a specific single voltage-gated sodium channel (the sodium channel that closes down before TENS is believed to act ) is a major mediator in this effect. An alternative mechanism of action is now thought to occur with TENS or transcutaneous",

On a low pulse ( 1 - 40 Hz ) they cause a decrease in contraction of muscle tissue . This reduction is reversed when the current is stopped. This fact can potentially be used in the treatment of spasticity, where a decrease in muscle contractions is desired . Theoretically, this decrease in muscle activity could be caused by peripheral nerve blockade or blockade of motor endplates . The former seems to be more likely, because low-frequency stimulation ( LFS ) evokes hypercontraction after stopping the current. This is in contrast to muscle relaxation after peripheral nerve injury . This phenomenon does not arise in the same manner with high-frequency stimulations . Another study conducted in humans showed a similar phenomenon among patients with multiple sclerosis . After administering LFS of 2 Hz to the tibialis anterior muscle on",

This proposes that there is a gate mechanism in the brain and spinal cord nerves ( the central nervous system ) . When the gate is open , pain messages get through to the brain and we feel pain . When the gate is closed , these pain messages are blocked and we do not feel pain . TENS machines are thought to stimulate certain non - pain - carrying nerves and close the gate . In effect , the brain is busy dealing with the messages it receives quickly from the TENS machine , rather than the slower ( more painful ) pain signals that the body is receiving from elsewhere . It explains why , if you injure yourself , rubbing that area can temporarily reduce the pain . When the machine is set on a low pulse rate ( 2 - 5 Hz ) it stimulates the body to make its own pain - easing chemicals called endorphins . These act a bit like morphine to block pain signals .,"

Dyspraxia is a developmental disorder , which means that it affects the way the parts of the nervous system work together during the child\u2019s development.

It gives quite high estimates of religiosinity in the USA.

In the 1980s, the perception of sound was seen to arise from sensory hair cells, through neuronal signal to the central nervous system via the cochlear nucleus.

Most children dislike wearing a rigid brace at night as it can be uncomfortable and impairs sleep [50, 51]. It is difficult for patients to go to social events because the brace cannot be worn underneath clothing . Adherence to night-time bracewear can be poor, especially in older children [50\u201355].

An operation is sometimes advised for people with severe scoliosis , although if a brace is worn it should be possible to prevent the need for surgery . The aim of the operation is to correct the curve , to stabilise the spine and also to fuse the curve . Fusion is the joining of two or more back bones ( vertebrae ) . Implants or rods are often used to keep the back straight after the operation . These rods are usually lengthened every 4 - 6 months as you grow . There are different surgical techniques used .

The symptoms and the degree of regurgitation will determine whether there is a need for the mitral annuloplasty. In severe mitral regurgitation the heart increases its speed and activity in order to supply oxygenated blood to tissues . This leads to dilatation of all the cardiac chambers.

The viral rind may be a key factor in clinical virology diagnostic analysis and clinical therapy, and it's features need to be urgently identified and urgently studied, especially the characteristics of viral transmissibility during human to animal. These investigations will not only provide the basis for scientific control of animal epidemic diseases caused by animal viruses but also contribute to the prevention and control of human epidemic diseases brought about by human to animal transmission.

Other causes of hypothyroidism include : Worldwide , iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . ( Your body needs iodine to make thyroxine . ) This affects some countries more commonly than others , depending on the level of iodine in the diet . A side - effect to some medicines - for example , amiodarone and lithium . Other types of thyroid inflammation ( thyroiditis ) caused by various rare conditions . A pituitary gland problem is a rare cause . The pituitary gland that lies just under the brain makes a hormone called thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) . This stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroxine . If the pituitary does not make TSH then the thyroid can not make enough thyroxine . Some children are born with an underactive thyroid gland ( congenital hypothyroidism ) .,"

Other tests are not usually necessary unless a rare cause of hypothyroidism is suspected . For example , tests of the pituitary gland may be done if both the TSH and thyroxine levels are low .

This means that you are making enough thyroxine but the thyroid gland is needing extra stimulation from TSH to make the required amount of thyroxine .

For each ventricular beat, there are some 16,000,003 ( 3 \u00d7 106 ) cells beating approximately simultaneously for a period of about 2 seconds, thus producing what is believed to be a stable, 2-second impulse, or wave. The impulse is considered to be at its strongest when it passes through the heart muscle about the midpoint of the heart, which is also its centre. This is a point that we will return to later; the critical role of its correct position is well known, but to our knowledge, the role of the centre itself is still not fully appreciated, despite evidence that has been accumulating from the results of electrophysiological studies on the heart, both of the general anatomy and the behaviour of electrophysological impulses in the vicinity of its centre (section Anatomy).",

If there is no AV block the impulse then gets through the AV node, via the His\u2010Purkinje system into the ventricular tissues, causing the heart to contract. However due to the AV block there is a delay in this phase ( see Fig. 8 ). The main problem caused by even this mild type of AV block is that the ventricles do not contract enough in order to pump the blood hard enough up through the pulmonary artery to the lungs ( where there is increased pulmonary pressure ). This results in elevated pressure in the right ventricle leading to the development of what is diagnosed as pulmonary hypertension. This is a progressive pathological process, resulting frequently in what is termed as end\u2010stage right ventricular failure. This can lead to the closing of the tricuspid (right atrioventicular) valve to form a ' dead heart ' and this can lead to either death or",

However , a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle ( AV bundle ) acts like ' wires ' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles . The AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch . These then split into many tiny fibres ( the Purkinje system ) which conduct the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles . This makes the ventricles contract and pump blood through one - way valves into large arteries : The artery going from the right ventricle ( pulmonary artery ) takes blood to the lungs . The artery going from the left ventricle ( aorta ) takes blood to the rest of the body . The heart then rests for a short time ( diastole ) . Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole : The veins coming into the left atria bring blood from the lungs ( full of oxygen ) . The veins coming into the right atria bring blood from the body ( needing oxygen ) .,"
